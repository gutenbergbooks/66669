enough to visit the sea-side, what they ought
to look for, and where they ought to look for
it. And I can assure them that if they will only
take the trouble to see what there is to be
seen, they will find fresh objects of interest as
often as they go down upon the beach, and
that a sea-side holiday will prove ten times as
delightful as ever they found it before.</p>

FISHES</h2>

<h3>PLATE I<br />

THE GOBIES (1 and 2)</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">IN this little book I want to talk to you about
some of the strange and wonderful creatures
which you may find when you go to stay by the
sea-side. And first of all I should like to tell you
something about the fishes. A great many of
these, of course, live in the deep water, where you
cannot catch them, or even see them. But there
are a good many others which you can find very
easily indeed. All that you have to do is to wait
until the tide has gone out, and then to go down
and look into the pools which are left among
the rocks. There you are almost sure to see
a number of shadowy forms darting to and fro
through the water. Some of these, most likely,
will be shrimps and prawns, which are always
very common in the rock-pools; but the others
will be tiny fishes. And even if you have not
got a net you can often catch them quite easily.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
Just bale out the water with a small pail, or even
with your hands, until the pool is nearly empty, and
you will be able to seize them with your fingers.</p>

<p>Among the fishes which can be caught in this
manner are several kinds of Gobies. You can
easily tell them from all other fishes by the
curious way in which their lower fins are made.
These fins are placed close together, so as to
form a kind of cup-shaped sucker or soft pad, by
means of which the little creatures can cling so
firmly to the rocks that even a wave will not wash
them from their hold. And if you take them home
alive and put them into a basin full of sea-water,
they will cling to the sides and stare at you in
a most inquisitive way! Owing to this habit the
gobies are often called &#8220;rock-fishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The commonest of these odd little creatures,
perhaps, is the Black Goby. But the Spotted
Goby is very nearly as plentiful. It is rather hard
to see, because it is coloured just like the sand
at the bottom of the pool, on which it is very fond
of resting. But if you scoop out the water from a
shallow pool you will often find, not only the goby,
but its nest as well. For this little fish makes
a most curious nest in which to place its eggs.
First of all it hunts about till it has found half
an empty cockle-shell, lying at the bottom of the
water with its hollow side downwards. It then
scoops out the sand from underneath it, so as to
form a little chamber about as big as a marble.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
You would think that the walls of this chamber
would very soon fall in, wouldn&#8217;t you? But the
fish smears them all over with a kind of slime,
which very soon sets and becomes quite hard, just
like cement. It then makes a tunnel leading into
the chamber by means of which it can go in and
out; and last of all it covers the cockle-shell all
over with loose sand. So unless you look very
carefully at the bottom of the pool you will not see
the nest at all. But if you notice a kind of lump
in the sand, and find that half a cockle-shell is
buried underneath it, you may be pretty well sure
that you have discovered the home of a spotted
goby.</p>

<p>This nest is always made by the male fish, and
when it is quite finished his mate comes and lays
her eggs in it. Then for eight or nine days he
remains on guard outside the entrance, so as to
prevent any hungry creature from finding its way
in and devouring them. At the end of that time
the eggs hatch, and a number of baby gobies make
their appearance; and although they are so small
that one can hardly see them, the father-fish
seems to think that they are quite able to take
care of themselves. So he swims away, and leaves
them to their fate.</p>

<p>If you catch these little fishes with your fingers
you must be careful how you handle them, for
they have rather long and sharp teeth, and can
give quite a smart bite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span></p>


<h3>PLATE II<br />

THE SMOOTH BLENNY (1)</h3>

<p>This fish, which is sometimes known as the
Shanny, is also very common in the rock-pools.
But you are not likely to see it unless you bale
out all the water from a pool, for it always hides
during the daytime in the crannies among the
rocks, or underneath sea-weeds. Or it will even
burrow down into the sandy mud beneath a big
stone, so that you will not find it at all unless you
dig for it.</p>

<p>When it is fully grown this fish is about five
inches long, and it is quite a remarkable creature
in several different ways.</p>

<p>In the first place, it varies a great deal in colour.
Sometimes it is partly green and partly yellow,
sometimes it is olive brown nearly all over, and
sometimes it is almost black. But you can
always tell it by the ring of bright crimson which
surrounds each eye.</p>

<p>In the second place, it can remain for quite a
long time out of the water. Some fishes die
almost at once if they are taken out of the sea.
But a blenny can live on dry land for twenty-four
hours at least. The reason is that its gills are
made in such a way that they remain damp for a
long while after the fish leaves the water; and as
long as the gills are moist it is able to breathe.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p class="ph1"><a id="plate2"><span class="smcap">Plate II</span></a></p>

<p class="caption">1. THE SMOOTH BLENNY.<span class="gap">2. THE SPOTTED GUNNELL.</span></p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>So very often indeed a smooth blenny will hide
in a crevice which is left quite dry when the tide
begins to fall, and will stay there till it rises again,
perhaps eight or ten hours later.</p>

<p>But the oddest thing about this little fish is that
it can move one of its eyes about without moving
the other! Have you ever seen a chameleon? If
so, you must have noticed how it will turn one of
its curious eyes, first in one direction, and then in
another, while the other eye remains quite still.
And the blenny can move its eyes in just the same
way, so that very often when one of them is looking
out in front the other will be looking out behind.
And then one will twist round and look upwards,
while the other twists round and looks down!</p>

<p>If you succeed in catching a smooth blenny, you
can always tell it from the other fishes which live
in the rock-pools by the deep notch in the middle
of the fin which runs along its back.</p>


<h3>PLATE II<br />

THE SPOTTED GUNNELL (2)</h3>

<p>Another small fish which is very common in the
rock-pools is the Spotted Gunnell. It is often
known as the &#8220;butter-fish,&#8221; and if you try to
catch it you will very quickly learn the reason
why; for it will slip between your fingers just
as if it had been smeared all over with butter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
Nearly all fishes are slippery, but the spotted
gunnell is the most slippery of all, for its whole
body is covered with such a thick coat of greasy
slime that it is really hardly possible to hold it.</p>

<p>Sometimes the spotted gunnell is light brown
in colour, and sometimes it is dark brown. But
you can always tell it by its shape, which is very
much like that of an eel, for its body is long and
flat, and is of almost the same width the whole
way along, from the head to nearly the tip of the
tail. Then instead of having two fins on its back
quite separate from one another, as most fishes
have, the spotted gunnell has one very narrow
fin which runs the whole length of the body. So,
you see, it is very much like an eel indeed. But
you can always tell it by the row of black
spots, bordered with white, on the lower edge
of the back-fin. When fully grown it is about
six inches long.</p>


<h3>PLATE III<br />

THE DRAGONET (1)</h3>

<p>You will not find this little fish in the rock-pools
nearly so often as the gobies and the gunnells, for
it generally lives at the bottom of the sea at some
little distance from the shore. But now and then
it comes swimming up as the tide rises, and gets
left behind as it falls again, so that for a few
hours, at any rate, it is obliged to stay in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
pools. It is a most beautiful little creature, and,
strange to say, the male is much more handsome
than the female, for he is golden yellow above
and white beneath, with streaks and spots of lilac
upon his back and sides, while his mate is reddish-yellow
all over. Besides this, he has the front
spine of his first back-fin drawn out to such a
length that it reaches almost to the tip of his tail,
while all his other fins are very long and very
spiny. He really does look, indeed, very much
like a tiny water-dragon. That is the reason, of
course, why he is called the &#8220;dragonet.&#8221; The
female, however, has much smaller fins. Indeed,
she is so very unlike the male that until a few
years ago even naturalists thought that she was
a different fish altogether, and she was generally
known as the Fox, on account of her reddish
colour.</p>

<p class="caption">1. THE DRAGONET.<span class="gap">2. THE PIPE-FISH.</span></p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>If you ever succeed in finding a dragonet in the
rock-pools it is almost sure to be a female, for the
male hardly ever comes into shallow water.</p>


<h3>PLATE III<br />

THE PIPE-FISH (2)</h3>

<p>This is a very odd-looking fish indeed&mdash;quite
the most curious of all the fishes which live in the
rock-pools. And as it is very common, you ought
to be able to find it without any difficulty.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>In the first place, although it grows to a length
of eighteen or nineteen inches, its body, even in
the largest part, is no bigger round than a slate-pencil.
For this reason it is often known as the
Needle Fish.</p>

<p>Besides this, its jaws are drawn out to a most
wonderful length, and are fastened together all
the way along, so that they really form a kind of
tube. So, you see, a pipe-fish can never open or
shut its mouth, but has to suck in its food through
the tiny hole at the tip of the jaws.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as you look down into a rock-pool,
you may see one of these fishes feeding; and the
way in which it does so is very curious indeed. It
suspends itself almost upright in the water, with
its tail upwards and its head downwards. It then
fills its tube-like mouth with water, which it
squirts out again as hard as it possibly can. The
result is, of course, that the sand at the bottom
of the pool is blown away, and the various tiny
creatures which were lying hidden underneath it
are uncovered. Then the fish sucks them up into
its mouth, and swallows them.</p>

<p>Another curious fact about the pipe-fish is that
instead of being clothed with scales, as most fishes
are, it is covered all over with hard bony plates,
just like a suit of armour. But the strangest
thing of all about it is that underneath the body
of the male fish is a kind of pouch, into which the
female puts her eggs, so that he can carry them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
about in safety until they hatch! Isn&#8217;t that odd?
And it is even said that after the little fishes are
hatched they will go back into their father&#8217;s pouch
if they are frightened, just as baby kangaroos do
into that of their mother, and remain there until
the danger has passed away!</p>


<h3>PLATE IV<br />

THE FLOUNDER</h3>

<p>This is one of the &#8220;flat fishes,&#8221; as everybody
calls them, like the turbot and the sole. Yet,
really and truly, these creatures are not flat at all.
They are thin. For what we always call the back
of a sole is not really its back. It is one of its
sides. And what we always call its lower surface
is not its lower surface, but its other side!</p>

<p>This sounds very strange, doesn&#8217;t it? But the
fact is that when these so-called &#8220;flat&#8221; fishes
are first hatched they swim upright, just as all
other fishes do. Then their backs are upwards, of
course, and their lower surfaces are downwards,
and one of their sides is on either side. For about
a month they swim about in this way. At the end
of that time a strong desire comes over them to
go and lie down on the sand or mud at the bottom
of the sea. Now, in order to do this, of course,
they have to lie upon their sides. Then three
very strange things happen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>In the first place, their colour changes. Until
now, both sides of the body have been pearly or
silvery white. A white fish, however, lying on
yellow sand or brown mud, would be very easily
seen, and some hungry creature would be sure to
catch sight of it and devour it. So as soon as the
little fish lies down the upper side begins to get
darker, and in a very short time it is of just the
same colour as the sand or mud all round it. If
you look into a shallow pool in which some of
these fishes are lying you will find it very difficult
indeed to see them, for they look exactly like the
surface on which they rest.</p>

<p>In the second place, their way of swimming
changes. When they first hatch out from the egg
these little fishes swim just as other fishes do&mdash;upright,
by means of their tails. For of course
you know that fishes do not swim with their fins,
which merely help them to keep their balance in
the water. But when they lie down at the bottom
of the sea they give up this way of swimming, and
wriggle their way, as it were, through the water,
still lying upon one side.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="chapter">
<p class="ph1"><a id="plate4"><span class="smcap">Plate IV</span></a></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_010.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE FLOUNDER.</p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>But the oddest change of all takes place in
the position of the eyes. You can easily see, of
course, that if a fish with its eyes in the usual
place lies down on one side at the bottom of the
sea, one eye is underneath its head, and is quite
useless. So you might think that, except when
it was swimming, it would only be able to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
with one of its eyes. But a very strange thing
indeed happens as soon as it lies down on the mud.
The lower eye actually begins to move, and slowly
travels round the head, till at last it settles down
by the side of the other! That sounds impossible,
doesn&#8217;t it? It is as wonderful as anything in a
fairy story. Yet in every one of these so-called
&#8220;flat&#8221; fishes that strange journey of the eye takes
place.</p>

<p>Next time you pass by a fishmonger&#8217;s shop just
look at the soles or the flounders in his window,
and you will see that in every one of these fishes
the two eyes are quite close together, above the
same corner of the mouth. That is because one
of the eyes moved right across the head while the
fish was quite small, so that it might be able to
use them both as it lay at the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>You can sometimes catch flounders by paddling
in the sea in places where the bottom is rather
muddy. After a little while you are almost sure
to feel one of these fishes wriggling underneath
your feet, and all that you have to do is to stoop
down and seize it.</p>


<h3>PLATE V<br />

THE PLAICE</h3>

<p>In its habits the plaice is very much like the
flounder, except that it does not like lying upon
mud, and always chooses a spot where the bottom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
of the sea is sandy. And the skin of the upper
side of its body, instead of growing dark brown,
like the colour of mud, becomes speckled and
spotted like the surface of sand. The fish is
always very careful indeed to conceal itself, for
even when the sea-bottom is sandy it does not lie
upon the surface, but wriggles its way right down
into the sand, only leaving just its eyes and a
small part of its head above it.</p>

<p>You can always tell a plaice when you see it
by the bright reddish-yellow spots upon the upper
side of its body and its fins. And besides these, it
always has a row of little bony knobs on the upper
side of its head. You can catch it just as you can
catch flounders, by paddling in the sea. But the
plaice which are caught in this way are always
quite small ones, for the bigger fish, which sometimes
weigh as much as twelve or even fifteen
pounds, live in the deeper water at some little
distance from the shore.</p>


<h3>PLATE VI<br />

THE EGG OF THE SKATE (1)</h3>

<p>Very often indeed, as you walk along the sea-shore,
you will find a curious object which the
fishermen generally call a &#8220;mermaid&#8217;s purse.&#8221; It
is about three inches long and two inches wide,
and is made of a black, horny substance, so tough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
and hard that it is very difficult indeed to tear it.
And from each corner there projects a slender
tube, about an inch in length. In fact it looks
rather like a hand-barrow, with handles in front
as well as at the back, instead of wheels.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="chapter">
<p class="ph1"><a id="plate5"><span class="smcap">Plate V</span></a></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_013.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE PLAICE.</p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>This is an egg of that very curious fish which
we call the Skate, and which looks something like
one of the &#8220;flat&#8221; fishes with a long whip-like tail.
So it is sometimes called a &#8220;skate-barrow.&#8221;
When it is flung up on the beach by the waves
the egg is nearly always empty. But if you
happen to be staying by the sea-side in the early
spring, and go down for a walk along the beach
after a violent storm, you may perhaps find one
of these eggs with a baby skate inside it. And if
you examine the egg very carefully, you will find
that while one end is firmly closed up, the other
end has a slit running right across it, and that
this slit is made in such a way that it allows the
little fish to pass out quite easily when the proper
time comes, but quite prevents any other creature
from coming in.</p>


<h3>PLATE VI<br />

THE EGG OF THE DOG-FISH (2)</h3>

<p>On some parts of the coast you may often
find an empty egg which is very much like that
of the skate, for it is made of just the same horny
material, and is of just the same shape. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
at the four corners, instead of having straight
projections like the handles of a barrow, it has
long, twisted tendrils, just like those of a vine.</p>

<p>This is the egg of the Dog-fish, which is really
a kind of small shark. It is not big or strong
enough to be dangerous to human beings; but
it is a terrible enemy to such small fishes as
pilchards and herrings. For a number of these
creatures form themselves into a band and go
hunting together, just like a pack of wild dogs.
And they will follow the shoal about day after
day, snapping up the poor helpless fishes in hundreds
and thousands.</p>

<p>When a dog-fish lays its eggs, it seems to fasten
them down by their tendrils to the weeds which
are growing at the bottom of the sea; and these
hold them so firmly that unless the weeds are
torn up with them, they never break away. At
each end of the egg is a small hole, allowing
a current of water to pass over the little fish
inside it. And at one end there is a slit, just
like that in the egg of the skate, which can only
be pushed open from the inside. So the little
dog-fish can get out, while its enemies cannot
get in.</p>

<p class="caption">1. THE EGG OF SKATE.<span class="gap">2. THE EGG OF DOG-FISH.</span></p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>Very often, after a violent storm, you may find
a dead dog-fish lying upon the shore; and even
if you have never seen one of these creatures
before you can tell at once what it is, because
its skin is so rough that it feels exactly like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
piece of sand-paper. So this skin is often used
for covering the handles of swords, in order to
give a firm grip; and sometimes narrow strips of
it are fastened to the sides of boxes of lucifer
matches.</p>

THE MOLLUSCS</h2>
</div>

<h3>PLATE VII<br />

THE CUTTLE (1 and 2)</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">WE now come to the Molluscs, or Soft-bodied
Animals, of which there are a very great
many. Some of them live in shells, like the oyster
and the whelk, and are often spoken of as &#8220;shell-fishes.&#8221;
But they are not really fishes at all, for
they have no bones as fishes have, and are made
in quite a different way. And there are just a
few of them which have no shells at all.</p>

<p>One of these is that very curious creature
which we call the Cuttle. You may sometimes
find it in the rock-pools, lurking in the crevices
among the rocks, or hiding under the masses
of sea-weeds which grow round the edges. It
has a soft, white, bag-like body, and a big head,
on which are two great staring black eyes. Just
above these eyes eight long slender arms spring
out; for cuttles keep their arms on their heads
instead of on their bodies! And another arm
which is even longer still, and is flattened out
at the end into a kind of oval plate, hangs down
on either side.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>All these arms are set with rows of round
suckers, which are so strong that if even a small
cuttle catches hold of you, it will not be very
easy to make him let go. So if you do happen
to find a cuttle in a rock-pool it will be better to
watch him in the water, without attempting to
catch him.</p>

<p>Down in the middle of all these branching arms,
just where they spring from the head, are two
very curious organs. The first of these is the
beak, which is very strong, very sharp, and a
good deal hooked. In fact, it is rather like that
of a parrot. The other consists of two tubes
which run downwards into the head, lying side
by side together like the barrels of a double-barrelled
gun.</p>

<p>These tubes are called the &#8220;siphon,&#8221; and they
are used for three purposes.</p>

<p>First of all, they are used for breathing. The
cuttle breathes water by means of gills, like those
of fishes, which lie inside the head; and the
water passes down to them through one of the
siphon tubes, and then goes out again through
the other.</p>

<p>Next, they are used for swimming. When a
cuttle wants to swim it gathers all its arms
together in front of its head, fills both its siphon
tubes with water, and then squirts their contents
out again as hard as it can. The result is that
two jets of water come rushing out of its head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
with such force that the surrounding water cannot
give way fast enough before them. So they push
the cuttle backwards so swiftly that if it were
to dart across the pool you would hardly be able
to follow its movements.</p>

<p>The third use of the siphon tubes is a very
strange one indeed. Sometimes while you are
looking at a cuttle in a rock-pool, the water all
round it will suddenly become quite dark, just as
if a quantity of ink had been poured into the pool.
And so it has; for inside its body the cuttle has
a bag which contains a quantity of a deep black
liquid called &#8220;sepia.&#8221; This bag is surrounded
by powerful muscles, and opens into the siphon
tubes; so that when the animal contracts the
muscles, the sepia is squirted out into the pool.
It always does this if it is frightened; and under
cover of the darkened water it nearly always succeeds
in making its escape.</p>

<p>Inside its body the cuttle also has a very curious
object which is generally called a &#8220;cuttle-bone.&#8221;
It is not really a bone, however, but is made of
almost pure chalk, and seems to act as a kind of
support for the bodily organs.</p>

<p class="caption">1. THE CUTTLE.<span class="gap">2. THE EGGS OF CUTTLE.</span></p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>Another very odd thing about the cuttle is the
way in which it lays its eggs. These look just
like purple grapes, and each has a small stalk, by
means of which they are fastened together in
bunches. Indeed, the fishermen always call them
&#8220;sea-grapes.&#8221; You may often find them lying about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
upon the beach in early spring, and if you open
one of them carefully, you will find a little baby
cuttle inside it.</p>


<h3>PLATE VIII<br />

THE WHELK (1 and 2)</h3>

<p>Everybody knows the shells of whelks by sight,
and you can hardly take a walk along the sea-shore
without seeing hundreds of them lying about
on the beach. And great numbers of whelks are
caught for human food, and also to serve as bait
for fishes.</p>

<p>One very curious thing about whelks is the way
in which they lay their eggs. Very often indeed,
as you walk along the sandy sea-shore, you will
notice round clusters of yellowish white eggs,
which often go rolling along before the wind.
Each of these clusters is about as big as a cricket-ball,
and the eggs of which it is made up are
about as large as peas. Now these are the eggs
of whelks, and I think that every one who sees
them must wonder how these creatures can
possibly manage to lay such very big balls of
eggs. For each egg-ball is at least two or three
times as big as the biggest whelk.</p>

<p>But, after all, the explanation is quite a simple
one. When the eggs are first laid they are very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
small indeed. Each is no bigger than a tiny
pin&#8217;s head. Instead of having shells, however,
these eggs have tough but very elastic skins;
and these skins are made in such a way that
while they allow water to soak in from the outside,
they will not allow it to pass out again.
So as soon as the eggs are dropped into the
sea they begin to swell; and the result is that
before very long each egg is as big as a good-sized
pea.</p>

<p>If you pick up a cluster of these curious eggs
in the early spring and open them, you will find
inside each the shell of a very tiny whelk, which is
almost ready to hatch out.</p>


<h3>PLATE IX<br />

THE DOG WHELK (1)</h3>

<p>If you look in the ridges of small pebbles and
bits of broken coal which you will meet with
here and there on the sandy parts of the sea-shore,
you are quite sure to find a number of
very small whelk shells. They are brownish
yellow outside, and pinkish white inside, and
instead of being quite smooth, like those of the
common whelk, they are covered with a number
of ribs which run down from the peak to
the margin. And these ribs are broken up in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
such a way that they look almost like rows of
beads.</p>

<p class="caption">1. THE WHELK.<span class="gap">2. THE EGGS OF WHELK.</span></p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>These are the shells of the Dog Whelk, and if
you wait until the tide is quite low, and then hunt
about on the weed-covered rocks close to the edge
of the sea, you will very likely find some of the
living animals crawling about. They feed upon
the sea-weeds by means of a curious organ called
the tooth-ribbon. This is just a narrow strip
of gristle, set with row upon row of very tiny
hooked teeth; and by drawing this backwards
and forwards over the leaves of the weeds the
animal scrapes off very tiny pieces, which it then
swallows.</p>

<p>In the tooth-ribbon of one of these whelks there
are about a hundred rows of teeth, with about
nine teeth in each row: so that the animal has
nearly a thousand teeth altogether. But of
course you can only see them by means of a
powerful microscope.</p>


<h3>PLATE IX<br />

THE STING WINKLE (2)</h3>

<p>Although this creature is called a &#8220;winkle&#8221; it is
really one of the whelks. It is very common, and
you may often find its empty shell lying upon the
shore. It is white, or yellowish white, in colour,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
and is generally about an inch and a half in length,
with several high ridges running down it from the
top to the bottom, and a number of smaller ridges
running crosswise between them.</p>

<p>You would not think that this could be a very
dangerous creature, would you? It looks as harmless
as it can possibly be, and certainly you need
not be in the least afraid to pick up a sting
winkle if you find one crawling about, for it cannot
injure human beings. But to other shell-bearing
molluscs it is a very terrible foe indeed. I dare say
that you have often noticed, when you have been
picking up shells on the sea-shore, that a good
many of those shells had small round holes bored
through them. Well, those holes were pierced by
a sting winkle. For this animal is a creature of
prey, and feeds entirely on other animals which
live in shells; and when it meets with one it
fastens itself to its victim&#8217;s shell, and drills a hole
right through it by means of its tooth-ribbon.
It then pokes the tooth-ribbon through the hole
into the body of the animal inside, and draws it
back again. As it does so, of course, the sharp
hooked teeth drag away little bits of the animal&#8217;s
flesh, which the sting winkle swallows. It then
pokes its tooth-ribbon down again into the body
of the victim, and so on, over and over again,
until its hunger is satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span></p>


<h3>PLATE IX<br />

THE PERIWINKLE (3 and 4)</h3>

<p>Of course you know the Periwinkle very well
indeed by sight&mdash;and very likely by taste, too!
So there is no need for me to describe it. But
perhaps you did not know that there are two
different kinds of periwinkles. One of these
is the Common Periwinkle, which is very plentiful
indeed on many parts of the coast. You
may find it in thousands and thousands if you
hunt about on the weed-covered rocks near
the water&#8217;s edge when the tide is out, and no
matter how many of them are caught, there
always seem to be just as many again next
day. This is the periwinkle which is used for
food.</p>

<p>The other is the Dog Periwinkle. It is rather
larger, and has a stouter shell. If you want to
find it, you must look on the rocks about half-way
between high and low water-marks, and
there you will generally find it crawling about in
numbers. But it is not good for food, because
it often has a quantity of eggs inside its body,
and inside these eggs the shells of the baby
periwinkles are already formed, which make it
dreadfully gritty. Thrushes, however, as well as
a good many of the shore birds, do not mind this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
in the least, and they devour so many of both
these kinds of periwinkles that it is quite a wonder
that any are left alive.</p>


<h3>PLATE IX<br />

THE PURPURA (5)</h3>

<p>In size and shape this very common creature
is rather like the dog periwinkle. But its shell
is white in colour instead of bluish black, and
generally has two or three bands of light yellowish
brown running round it. You may often find it
crawling about on the weed-covered rocks when
the tide is out.</p>

3. THE PERIWINKLE.<span class="gap">4. THE DOG PERIWINKLE.</span><br />

5. THE PURPURA.</p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>The purpura is quite a famous creature, because
of the use which was made of it by the ancient
Romans. I dare say you know that in days of
old the colour of purple was very highly valued;
and among the Romans only members of the royal
family were allowed to dress in purple garments.
Now this purple dye was obtained from the
purpura. Inside its body this creature has a
little bag which contains about a drop of a thick
white liquid, rather like milk. Certainly it does
not look in the least like purple dye. But if you
were to squeeze it out on to a sheet of white
paper, and to place it in the sunshine, you would
very soon see that it was changing colour. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
a few minutes&#8217; time it would have turned to yellow.
After a little time longer you would notice a blue
tinge creeping into the yellow, and turning it to
green; and by degrees the blue would become
stronger and stronger, till the green disappeared.
At last a crimson tinge would creep into the blue
and turn it to purple; and this would be exactly
the same as the famous purple dye which the
ancient Romans valued so highly.</p>

<p>The eggs which are laid by the purpura are
very curious indeed, for they are fastened down
to stones by little stalks; so that each one looks
rather like an egg-cup with an egg inside it.
And inside each of these eggs are several little
purpuras instead of only one.</p>


<h3>PLATE X<br />

THE SEA SNAIL (1)</h3>

<p>This is one of the very commonest of all the
shell-bearing molluscs. You may find it crawling
about in numbers all over the weed-covered
rocks which are left bare as the tide goes down.
Its shell varies very much in colour, for it is
sometimes bright yellow, and sometimes pale
yellow, and sometimes olive green, and sometimes
brown, and sometimes almost black. Indeed,
you might almost think that there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
half-a-dozen different kinds of these sea snails
instead of only one.</p>

<p>These creatures have tooth-ribbons set with
hundreds of tiny hooked teeth, just like those
of the dog whelks, and they use them in feeding
upon the leaves of sea-weeds in just the
same way.</p>


<h3>PLATE X<br />

THE WENTLETRAP (2)</h3>

<p>The Wentletrap is one of the most beautiful
of all the shells which are to be found upon
the shore. Indeed, I really think that it is
quite the most beautiful. For the high ridges
which stand out so boldly run round and round
it in the most graceful curves, and the whole
shell looks just as if it had been carved out of
ivory.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="chapter">
<p class="ph1"><a id="plate10"><span class="smcap">Plate X</span></a></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_026.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">1. THE SEA SNAIL.<span class="gap">2. THE WENTLETRAP.</span></p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>The wentletrap is sometimes known as the
&#8220;staircase shell,&#8221; because the ridges which run
round it are very much like those spiral staircases
by which one climbs to the tops of
church towers and other lofty buildings. If you
want to find it, the best place to look is in the
ridges of small pebbles which are washed up
here and there on sandy coasts by the waves,
and which are generally mixed up with broken
coal which has been thrown out from passing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
ships. But it is not very common, and you must
not be disappointed if you do not succeed in
finding it.</p>


<h3>PLATE XI<br />

THE COMMON LIMPET (1)</h3>

<p>This is a very common creature indeed, and you
can find it in hundreds and thousands on any
rocky part of the coast. Numbers of its empty
shells are to be found lying about on the beach,
and if you go down among the rocks when the
tide is out you will often notice that in some
places they are so covered with limpets that you
can scarcely put the tip of your finger in between
them.</p>

<p>These animals cling to the rocks in the most
wonderful way. Indeed, if you take hold of a big
limpet between your fingers you will not be able to
move it in the least, even if you pull at it and push
at it as hard as you can. But if you take the
animal by surprise, and give it a sharp, sudden
blow sideways with a stone, or the end of a stout
stick, you can generally knock it off quite easily.
And you will very often find that a deep ring-shaped
mark has been worn away in the rock by
the sharp edges of its shell.</p>

<p>However, limpets do not always remain clinging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
to the rocks, for they can crawl about quite as
easily as snails can, by means of that soft, fleshy
part of the body which we call the &#8220;foot.&#8221; And if
you take them home alive, and put them into
an aquarium, you may often see them creeping up
and down the glass sides, through which you can
examine their bodies quite easily.</p>


<h3>PLATE XI<br />

THE KEY-HOLE LIMPET (2)</h3>

<p>There are a good many different kinds of
limpets, of which one of the most curious is the
Key-hole Limpet. It is generally found in rather
deep water, but you may sometimes find it clinging
to the rocks just above low-water mark. You
must choose a season of &#8220;spring-tide,&#8221; however,
for then the tide goes farther out than usual, and
leaves behind it a good many creatures which at
other times one hardly ever sees.</p>

<p>The shell of this creature is rather stouter than
that of the common limpet, and has a number of
ridges running down it from the peak to the
margin. Even by these you can tell it at once.
But if you look at it closely, you will also find that
just at the top of the peak there is a hole shaped
rather like a key-hole. Through this hole the
animal squirts out the water which has passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
over its gills; so that all the time that it is
breathing, if only one could see it, a kind of little
fountain is playing under water, spouting out from
the top of its shell!</p>


<h3>PLATE XI<br />

THE SMOOTH LIMPET (3)</h3>

<p>At first sight, perhaps, you would hardly take
this creature for a limpet at all, for it is ever so
much smaller than either the common or the key-hole
limpets, and has a very thin and delicate shell
indeed. It varies a good deal in colour, but generally
the shell is pale brown, looking almost like
polished horn, with eight or nine narrow streaks
of bright blue running down from the peak to the
margin. It is often called the &#8220;bonnet shell,&#8221;
because in shape it is rather like an old-fashioned
bonnet.</p>

<p>You may often find the empty shells of this
creature lying upon the shore. But if you take
them home you will find that as soon as they
become dry the beautiful blue streaks begin to
fade, and that after a few days you can hardly see
them at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span></p>


<h3>PLATE XI<br />

THE CUP AND SAUCER LIMPET (4)</h3>

<p>This is a very curious creature indeed. But if
you want to see why its rather odd name was
given to it, you must look inside its shell instead
of outside. Then you will see that in the upper
part is a curved plate which really looks very
much like a tiny tea-cup, while the shell itself
surrounds it just like a saucer. And if you were
to examine the animal which lives inside it very
carefully, and to pull out its long tooth-ribbon,
you would find at the tip of it a curious little
organ which looks just like a tea-spoon. So that
we have cup, saucer, and spoon all in one!</p>

<p>Perhaps you may wonder what the odd little
cup is for. Well, the fact is that the muscles by
means of which the animal clings to the rock
are very strong indeed. So, of course, there must
be something else very strong to which they can
be fastened, and this cup-shaped plate gives them
a very firm hold.</p>

<p>The cup and saucer limpet is not a very common
creature, and in many parts of the coast it is
never met with at all. But if you stay by the sea-side
on the south coast of England, you may
sometimes find its empty shell lying upon the
shore.</p>

<h3>PLATE XII<br />

THE PAINTED TOP (1)</h3>

<p>Tops are generally very common indeed on the
sandy parts of the shore. You cannot possibly
mistake their shells for those of any other
creatures, for they are cone-shaped, looking very
much like rather flattened sugar-loaves, and are
generally very beautifully coloured. So pretty
are they, indeed, that they are sometimes strung
together and worn as necklaces, or used for ornamenting
ladies&#8217; dresses.</p>

<p>The painted top is one of the most beautiful
of all these shells, for it is covered all over with
spots and streaks and blotches of scarlet, and
crimson, and pink, and purple, and white, and
blue, and yellow! But all this lovely colouring
is only on the outer coat of the shell, which is
very easily chipped off. The consequence is that
these shells are very often damaged by being
tossed to and fro by the waves, and though you
may often find twenty or thirty in the course of
a morning, not more than two or three, perhaps,
will be quite uninjured.</p>

<p>Tops are very useful creatures to have alive
in an aquarium, for they keep the glass sides
clean from the tiny green weeds which so quickly
grow upon them. They do this by means of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
tooth-ribbons, and you may see them crawling
about on the glass walls and mowing down the
weeds, just as a gardener cuts the grass on the
lawn with his scythe.</p>


<h3>PLATE XII<br />

THE GREY TOP (2)</h3>

<p>The painted top is rather a large shell, for it
is often nearly an inch in height from the peak
to the margin. But the Grey Top, which is even
commoner still, is a good deal smaller. It is
not nearly so brightly tinted as the painted top,
for it is yellowish grey in colour, with zigzag
black streaks running round and round it, which
give it rather a mottled look. Still, it is a very
pretty shell indeed.</p>

<p>If you look at a top shell from underneath,
you will always find that there is a small
hole in the bottom. This is the entrance to
a passage which runs right up into the peak
of the shell. In the grey top this hole is just
about big enough to admit a rather fine
needle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span></p>


<h3>PLATE XII<br />

THE COWRY (3)</h3>

<p>No doubt you have often found this very
pretty shell, for on the sandy parts of our coasts
it is sometimes very common. You may often
find twenty or thirty cowries, indeed, in one of
those ridges of pebbles and small coal which
are washed up by every tide. But if you were
to see the living animals crawling about I do
not think that you would ever guess what they
were, for their soft bodies come outside their
shells, which they cover up so completely that
you can hardly see them at all.</p>

<p>If you look on the upper part of the shell, you
will see that a pale streak runs across it from
one side to the other. This streak marks the
line where the edges of the two sides of the
body almost meet.</p>

<p>In some parts of the world cowry shells are
used instead of money. It seems rather an easy
way of getting rich, doesn&#8217;t it, just to go and
pick up shells on the sea-shore? But then
fifteen hundred of these cowries are only worth
about a shilling, so that you would have to pick
up a very great many even if you only wanted
to do a day&#8217;s shopping! And then they are ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
so much bigger than our English cowries, so
that it would not be very easy to carry them
about. You would have to take several sacks
full of cowries with you when you went to make
a purchase, instead of just keeping your money
in a purse!</p>


<h3>PLATE XII<br />

THE CHITON (4)</h3>

<p>The chiton is one of the oddest of all the shell-bearing
molluscs; for it does not look like a
mollusc at all. It looks much more like a kind
of sea woodlouse, or a very tiny armadillo. For
instead of having a single shell like a whelk
or a periwinkle, or a double one like a cockle
or an oyster, it has eight shelly plates on its
back which overlap one another, just like the
tiles on the roof of a house. And if you touch
it, it will often roll itself up into a kind of ball,
just like the pill-millepedes, or &#8220;monkey-peas,&#8221;
which are so common in our gardens.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

3. THE COWRY.<span class="gap">4. THE CHITON.</span></p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>This creature is called the Chiton, and if you
want to find it you must go and look on the
piles at the end of a pier, or on the rocks which
are left bare at very low tides. There you will
often find it in hundreds. Generally it is ashy
grey in colour, but it varies a good deal in hue,
and you will sometimes find examples which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
are streaked and mottled with pink, and orange,
and white, and lilac, and chocolate brown.</p>

<p>Before a chiton reaches its perfect form it
passes through a kind of caterpillar stage, and
then turns into a sort of chrysalis, just as an
insect does. And both the caterpillar and the
chrysalis, strange to say, have eyes upon their
heads, while the perfect chiton has none. But
some chitons have eyes all over their shells
instead, and in some of these very odd creatures
between eleven and twelve thousand eyes have
been counted, the shells being almost entirely
covered with them; so that the animals may
really be said to see with their whole bodies!</p>

BIVALVE MOLLUSCS</h2>
</div>

<h3>PLATE XIII<br />

THE OYSTER (1)</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE &#8220;bivalve&#8221; molluscs are so called because
they live in shells made of two parts, or
&#8220;valves,&#8221; which are fastened together by means
of a hinge. There are a great many of these,
and the Oyster is one of the best known of
them all.</p>

<p>This creature is only found in places where
the bottom of the sea is muddy, because in
sandy places the sand is very apt to get into
the hinges of the shells and to prevent them
from being closed; and in that case the animal
very soon dies from suffocation. So oysters are
generally found in the mouths of rivers, or in
land-locked bays where there is no sand at all.</p>

<p>The history of these creatures is a very curious
one indeed.</p>

<p>In the month of May the mother oyster produces
a very large number of eggs&mdash;sometimes as
many as eight or nine hundred thousand! These
are called &#8220;oyster spat,&#8221; and for several weeks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
she keeps them in her gills. Then one day she
suddenly opens her valves and squirts them out
into the water, where they look like a little cloud
of the finest possible dust. For a short time after
these eggs hatch the baby oysters swim about,
and travel backwards and forwards as the tide
rises and falls. After a while, however, they sink
down and fasten themselves to some object at the
bottom of the sea; and when once they have done
this they never move again. They always lie
upon their left sides, with the smaller and flatter
of the two valves uppermost; and there they
remain for five years at least before they reach
their full size.</p>

<p>Oysters feed, too, in a very odd way. You
know, perhaps, that inside the shell of an oyster
there is a tufted organ which we call the &#8220;beard.&#8221;
This consists of the gills. Hidden away underneath
these is the mouth; and the gills do not
merely suck out the air which has been dissolved
in the water, as those of other animals do, but
sift out every little tiny scrap of decaying matter
which the oyster can use for food as well. So an
oyster&#8217;s gills enable it to breathe and to catch its
dinner at the same time!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span></p>


<h3>PLATE XIII<br />

THE SADDLE OYSTER (2)</h3>

<p>This is a very curious oyster; for in its flat
lower valve, just below the hinge, is a large oval
hole. Through this hole passes a strong band of
muscle, to which is fastened a kind of shelly knob
which looks just like a button. By means of this
the animal fastens itself down to some object at
the bottom of the sea; and very often indeed it is
found attached to the shells of other molluscs,
looking something like the saddle on the back
of a horse. That is why it is called the &#8220;saddle
oyster.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another curious fact about this creature is
that very often its shape completely alters as
it grows older. While it is quite small it
looks very much like an ordinary oyster. But
as time goes on it generally takes the form
of the object on which it rests. So you might
easily find half-a-dozen shells of the saddle
oyster, not one of which would be shaped like
any of the others.</p>

<h3>PLATE XIII<br />

THE COCKLE (3)</h3>

<p>This is one of the very commonest of all the
creatures of the sea-shore, and you may find its
heart-shaped shells lying about on the beach in
hundreds and thousands. In many places, indeed,
cockle-shells are found in such wonderful
numbers that they are crushed up and used for
covering pathways instead of gravel.</p>

<p>Yet you may wander about on the shore day
after day for weeks together and never see a
living cockle. How is this?</p>

<p>Well, the reason is that cockles live buried
underneath the sand. If you go down near the
edge of the waves when the tide is quite low, and
just stand still for a minute or two and watch, you
are almost sure to see first one little jet of water,
and then another, and then another, come squirting
up out of the sand into the air. Now these
little jets of water are thrown up by cockles
which are lying buried in the wet sandy mud
below. For every now and then these creatures
draw down a little water into their gills, through
one of their siphon tubes, and when they have
sucked all the air out of it they squirt it up
again through the other.</p>

<p>Would you like to dig one of them up and look
at it? Well, just take a wooden spade and try.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
You will find that you cannot do it, for the cockle
can dig a good deal faster than you can. The
fact is that he has a very strong, fleshy organ
which we call the &#8220;foot,&#8221; and with this he can
burrow down into the sandy mud so quickly
that by the time you have dug to a depth of six
inches, he will have gone down to the depth
of ten or twelve.</p>

<p>The cockle uses this &#8220;foot&#8221; for another purpose
as well, for he can jump with it. And if you did
succeed in digging him out of the ground, you
would very likely see him skipping about in the
most active way, almost like a sandhopper!</p>

<p>Upon some parts of the coast another kind of
cockle is found, which has its &#8220;foot&#8221; of a bright
red colour. For this reason it is generally known
as the &#8220;red-nosed cockle.&#8221;</p>


<h3>PLATE XIV<br />

THE MUSSEL (1 and 2)</h3>

<p>Mussels are almost, if not quite, as plentiful as
cockles. If you walk down underneath a pier or a
jetty when the tide is out, you will often find that
the pillars which support it are covered with great
clusters of these creatures; and very often the
rocks which are left dry at low-water are covered
with them in just the same way. They fasten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
themselves down by means of a bundle of very
strong threads, which we call the &#8220;byssus&#8221;; and
these hold so firmly, that although the waves
may beat upon a bed of mussels day after day
all through the year, they never succeed in tearing
them away.</p>

<p>Near the town of Bideford in Devonshire, indeed,
there is a bridge which is only kept standing
by means of mussels. This bridge, which is a
very long one, with twenty-four arches, runs across
the Towridge River, close to the place where it
joins the Taw; and the tide runs so rapidly that
if mortar is used to repair the bridge it is very
soon washed away. So boat-loads of mussels are
brought to the bridge from time to time, and these
anchor themselves down so firmly by means of
their byssus threads that they actually hold the
stone-work together!</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, mussels do a great deal
of harm, for they will get into an oyster-bed and
fasten themselves down upon the shells of the
oysters. Their byssus threads then form a kind
of thick mat, which collects and holds the mud
that is brought up by the tide every time that
it rises; and this very soon covers the oysters
entirely up, and smothers them to death.</p>

<p>Mussels do not remain fastened down in one
place for the whole of their lives, however, as
oysters do. They can crawl about quite easily
whenever they like. And they do this, also, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
means of their byssus threads. First they move
a few of these threads forward, and take a fresh
hold with them; then they draw the rest up after
them; and then they move the front ones forward
once more, and so on over and over again.</p>

<p>Mussels are very largely used for food, and
also as bait for deep-sea fishing. In the Firth of
Forth alone, indeed, nearly forty millions of these
creatures are collected every year for this latter
purpose alone, or one for every man, woman, and
child in England and Scotland and Wales!</p>


<h3>PLATE XIV<br />

THE HORSE MUSSEL (3)</h3>

<p>This is not a very handsome creature, for its
shell is covered all over with a rather thick brown
skin, which is very much wrinkled. It is quite
common in many places, and yet one does not
very often see it; for it is nearly always hidden
underneath its byssus threads, which grow
in thick masses. Besides this, it often burrows
underneath the surface of the sand; so that
unless you know just <i>where</i> to look for it, and
<i>how</i> to look for it, you are not likely to find it.</p>

</div>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>But if you go down to the pools at the very
edge of the water when the tide is quite low,
and scrape away the sand which is heaped up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
against the bottom of the rocks, you may very
likely come upon quite a large cluster of these
curious creatures.</p>

<p>Horse mussels are not used for food as common
mussels are, because they have a very strong
and unpleasant taste.</p>


<h3>PLATE XV<br />

THE VARIABLE SCALLOP (1)</h3>

<p>A good many different kinds of scallops are
found on our shores. One of them&mdash;the Common
Scallop&mdash;is as large as the palm of a man&#8217;s hand,
and is used for food. You may often see it in
fishmongers&#8217; shops. But you are not at all likely
to find its empty shells lying on the shore, for
it lives in rather deep water. You may find those
of the Variable Scallop, however, very often indeed
in places where the shore is sandy. It is
called the &#8220;variable&#8221; scallop because it varies so
much in colour that one hardly ever sees two of
its shells which are quite alike. Sometimes they
are crimson, sometimes pink, sometimes mauve,
sometimes dark yellow, sometimes golden yellow,
and sometimes blotched and mottled with different
colours. A number of ridges run down the
shell from the hinge to the margin, and on each
of these is a row of short spikes; so that the
animal looks something like a tipsy-cake!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>Scallops swim in a rather curious way, namely,
by opening and shutting their valves over and
over again. As often as they do this a jet of
water is squirted out, and this acts on the surrounding
water just like the jets which are
squirted from the siphon tubes of the cuttle, and
drives the animal along with some little speed.
As it travels through the water it looks very
pretty, for all round the edges of its shell it has
a fringe of long feelers, which wave up and down
in a most graceful way. By means of these it
obtains its food. At the base of these feelers is
a row of little black dots, which seem to be
eyes.</p>


<h3>PLATE XV<br />

THE RADIATED SCALLOP (2)</h3>

<p>This is rather a rare shell, and if you find it
lying upon the shore you will be fortunate. You
may know it at once if you <i>do</i> find it, for it only
has six or seven ridges running down it, instead
of about twice that number. It varies a good deal
in colour, but is generally reddish brown, spotted
and speckled with white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span></p>


<h3>PLATE XV<br />

THE HUNCHBACK SCALLOP (3)</h3>

<p>It is very easy to see why this creature is called
the &#8220;hunchback,&#8221; for although when it is quite
small it is shaped just like other scallops, it alters
in form very much as it grows bigger; so that
really it sometimes looks as if it had been
crumpled up when it was quite soft, and had
never recovered from the squeeze. Besides this,
the two valves are not alike, as they are in
other scallops, for while one is always very
deep and rounded, the other is nearly flat. So
when the animal is alive it really has a kind of
&#8220;hunchbacked&#8221; appearance; and if you found
its two valves lying apart from one another you
would hardly believe that they could both have
belonged to the same creature.</p>

<p>The colour of the hunchbacked scallop is
white, mottled with brick-red.</p>


<h3>PLATE XVI<br />

THE SUNSET SHELL (1 and 2)</h3>

<p>This is a very &#8220;local&#8221; shell. That is, it is
very common indeed in some places, so that you
might pick up hundreds and hundreds in a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
minutes, while in other places it is never found
at all. The best place in which to look for it
is a part of the beach where sand and mud are
mingled together, and there you will be almost
sure to find it.</p>

<p>The name of &#8220;sunset&#8221; shell has been given
to it because of the beautiful way in which the
inside surface is coloured. Sometimes it is rosy
pink all over; sometimes it is orange yellow;
sometimes it has crimson streaks upon a whitish
ground. But you can never look at it without
being reminded of the evening sky after a very
bright sunset. The outside of the shell, however,
is always white and chalky-looking, and no
one who saw the two valves fastened together
as they are when the animal is alive would have
the least idea how beautiful they really are.</p>

<p>This creature always lives buried in the sandy
mud, just as the cockle does. It has a very
powerful &#8220;foot,&#8221; by means of which it burrows,
and two long and very slender siphon tubes.</p>


<h3>PLATE XVI<br />

THE GAPER (3)</h3>

<p>This is another of the shell-bearing molluscs
which live in burrows in the sandy mud, and
it is called the &#8220;gaper&#8221; because the shells are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
always open at the top, just as if the animal were
yawning, or gaping. Through this opening the
siphon tubes project. These tubes are used in
breathing, just like those of the cuttle, and are
enclosed in a kind of leathery case, which the
animal can stretch out or draw back at will;
so that when it is lying at the bottom of its
burrow it can keep the tips of the siphon tubes
just above the surface of the mud, and so draw
water down to its gills quite easily.</p>

3. THE GAPER.</p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>On some parts of the coast gapers are used
as food. But if you want to buy some you must
not call them &#8220;gapers.&#8221; You must call them
&#8220;old maids&#8221;; for by that name they are always
called by the fishermen. Some of the sea-birds
are very fond of them too, and dig them out
of their burrows with their long beaks. And in
the far North millions and millions of them are
devoured by walruses, and also by Arctic foxes,
which prowl about the shore in search of them
every day when the tide goes down.</p>


<h3>PLATE XVII<br />

THE PIDDOCK (1)</h3>

<p>Now we come to one of the most wonderful
of all the creatures which live in the sea;
namely, the Piddock. You can find its empty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
shells lying about in numbers on almost any
part of the shore where the cliffs are made of
chalk or limestone. And if you look at the rocks
which are left dry when the tide goes down
you will see the entrances to its burrows&mdash;large,
oval holes, several of which you may often
find quite close together. For the piddock is
a boring shell, which drives its tunnels through
and through the rocks, until very often they are
quite honeycombed by its tunnels. Sometimes you
may meet with a big block of chalk which only
weighs about half as much as it should, because
all the rest has been cut away by piddocks.
And if you could split it open you would find
several of these creatures lying in their burrows.</p>

<p>But how they manage to cut their way through
the hard chalk, or the still harder limestone,
nobody quite knows. Most likely, however, they
do so partly by means of the soft part of the body
which we call the &#8220;foot,&#8221; and partly by means
of the shell, which they turn first a little bit
to one side, and then a little bit to the other
side, just like a man who is using a bradawl.
Every now and then, of course, the burrow gets
choked up with the material which has been
scraped away. But the piddock knows quite
well what to do in order to clear it. It just
squirts out a jet of water from the siphon tubes,
by means of which it breathes, and so washes
the burrow out!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>Now let me tell you why I said that the piddock
is one of the most wonderful of all the creatures
which live in the sea.</p>

<p>First of all, then, remember that the sea, acting
by itself, has very little power to wash away
chalk. For as soon as the waves begin to beat
upon the face of a chalk cliff, they leave on it
the spores, or seeds, of sea-weeds. Very soon
those spores begin to grow, and before long the
surface of the cliff is covered with masses of
weed, so that the sea hardly touches the chalk
underneath them at all. The waves might beat
upon the cliffs for hundreds and hundreds of
years without breaking it down.</p>

<p>But the piddock comes and burrows into the
chalk just below high-water mark. Backwards
and forwards it goes boring on, till at last only
thin dividing walls are left between its tunnels.
Then the sea washes in, and breaks down these
walls, so that the whole foundation of the cliff
is cut away. The result is, of course, that before
very long there is a landslip. Hundreds
of tons of chalk come tumbling down into the
sea. Then the piddocks begin work again a
little farther back, and by-and-by there is another
landslip.</p>

<p>You can see the effects of the piddock&#8217;s work
upon any part of the coast where there are
chalk cliffs. Just look at the beach when the
tide is out. You will notice long spits of weed-covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
rocks, which sometimes run far out into
the sea. Well, those rocks were not always
rocks. They were once the bottoms of cliffs.
But the piddocks and the sea, working together,
cut the cliffs down; so that the sea gained, yard
by yard, upon the land.</p>

<p>Indeed, I think that it may be said, quite truly,
that if it had not been for the work of the piddocks
Great Britain would not be an island! At
any rate we do know this, that once, a great many
hundreds of thousands of years ago, Great Britain
was not an island at all, but was joined to the
mainland of the Continent of Europe. And we
also know that the sea, acting by itself, could not
possibly have cut a passage through what we now
call the Straits of Dover. The piddocks helped it
to do so! They kept on cutting away the foundation
of the cliffs by boring backwards and forwards
through the solid chalk, just below the level of the
waves; and the sea finished the work which the
piddocks had begun, by breaking down the thin
dividing walls between their burrows.</p>


<h3>PLATE XVII<br />

THE LITTLE PIDDOCK (2 and 3)</h3>

<p>The common piddock grows to a length of from
three to five inches, and is almost always white
in colour, though sometimes it is stained by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
rocks in which it lives. But there is another kind
of piddock which is very much smaller, for its
shells hardly ever measure more than an inch and
a half in length, and are a good deal narrower in
proportion to their size. This creature is called
the Little Piddock. It is generally of a brownish
yellow colour, and you may often find its burrows
in great numbers in limestone rocks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />



<h3>PLATE XVIII<br />

THE SHIP-WORM (1 and 2)</h3>

<p>This creature certainly does not look in the
very least like a mollusc; and I do not think
that anybody who had never seen it before
would ever guess that it is really quite a near
relation of the piddocks. It looks much more
like a kind of worm, for it has a soft round
body no larger than an ordinary drawing pencil,
though it is often as much as ten or even twelve
inches in length. But if you were to look at the
head end of its body you would see its bivalve
shells, though they are so very small that they
might easily be mistaken for jaws. And these
would show you that the animal is really a shell-bearing
mollusc.</p>

<p>The shipworm is a most mischievous creature,
for instead of burrowing into chalk or limestone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
rocks, like the piddocks, it bores into timber, such
as the hulls of ships, and the posts which support
jetties and piers. Very often it cuts away more
than half the wood in a great beam, leaving only
the thinnest walls between its tunnels. And as it
works along it lines these tunnels with a curious
shelly substance, which strengthens them and prevents
them from breaking down.</p>

<p>By burrowing into timber in this way the shipworm
often does most terrible damage. But it
seems to dislike the taste of iron rust very much
indeed. So when a beam of timber has to be protected
from its attacks, a number of iron nails
with very broad, flat heads are driven into the
surface, with only the space of an inch or two
between them. The salt-water acts upon these
very quickly, and the result is that the whole of
the beam is very soon covered over with a thin
coating of rust, so that no shipworm will attempt
to touch it.</p>

<p class="caption">1. THE SHIP-WORM.<span class="gap">2. WOOD BORED BY SHIP-WORMS.</span></p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>When the shipworm is quite small it is not in
the least like the perfect animal. Indeed, if you
were to see a baby shipworm, I do not think that
you would ever guess what it was. It is really
a kind of shipworm caterpillar. In shape it is
nearly round, and is covered almost all over with
tiny hair-like organs, by means of which it swims
in the water. But the odd thing about it is that
it keeps on changing its form. After about thirty-six
hours it becomes oval. A few hours later, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
you were to look at it again, you would find that
it was almost triangular. A few hours later still
it would be round again, just as it was when it
first hatched out of the egg. And during this
time of its life it has a strong fleshy &#8220;foot,&#8221; like
that of a snail, so that if it becomes tired of
swimming it can settle down and crawl about
on the surface of the rocks.</p>

<p>Have you ever been through the Thames
tunnel? If you have, you will be interested to
know that it is made just like a shipworm&#8217;s
burrow, for a kind of boring instrument, called
a &#8220;shield,&#8221; was made, which enabled the workmen
to line the walls with masonry as fast as
the earth was cut away. In this way the walls
were prevented from falling in, and water from
the river above was kept from breaking through
the roof and flooding the tunnel. And Brunel,
the great engineer who constructed the tunnel,
admitted that the idea had come to him one
day when he was examining the burrow of this
wonderful mollusc.</p>


<h3>PLATE XIX<br />

THE RAZOR (1 and 2)</h3>

<p>If you walk about very quietly, when the tide
is out, on the stretch of wet, sandy mud which
lies just above low-water mark, you may often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
see a very curious object resting at the surface,
and looking just like a little key-hole. And if
you step heavily anywhere near it, it is almost
sure to squirt up a little jet of water into the air
and disappear. Then you may be quite sure that
you have found the burrow of a Razor Shell.</p>

<p>This is a very long, narrow creature with
bivalve shells, which are shaped almost exactly
like the handle of a razor. It is generally about
four or five inches in length and half-an-inch
in width, and the object which looks so like a
key-hole consists of its siphon tubes, the tips of
which rest just above the surface of the sand
when it is lying at the mouth of its burrow.
It digs by means of its strong, fleshy &#8220;foot,&#8221; just
as the cockle does, and its burrow, which goes
straight downwards just like a well, is often as
much as two feet deep. So it is not a very easy
thing to get a razor out of its tunnel. But if you
want to do so I can tell you how to manage it.
Just take a good big pinch of salt, and drop it
down into the hole. Now the razor does not
like salt at all, even though most of its life is
spent at the bottom of the salt-water, and it
comes up to the mouth of its burrow in a great
hurry to get rid of it. Then if you make a very
quick stroke with a spade you can dig it out
before it has time to get down to the bottom
again. But if you should fail to get it up at
the first attempt it is of no use to try again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
for even if you pour down a whole handful of salt
the animal will never come up a second time.</p>

</div>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>The razor is very good to eat, if its tough
leathery skin is slipped off, and on some parts of
the coast it is often used for food. The fishermen
use it for bait, too, and catch it by means
of a slender iron rod with a barbed tip, which
they thrust into its body as it lies at the bottom
of its burrow.</p>


<h3>PLATE XIX<br />

THE SABRE RAZOR (3)</h3>

<p>There are several different kinds of Razors,
and one of them is called the &#8220;sabre razor,&#8221;
because its shells are curved, just like the
scabbard of a sabre. It is fairly common, but
you are never likely to find its burrows, unless
you go to look for them just at low-water after
a spring-tide, because it almost always lives
below the ordinary low-water mark. But after
spring-tides&mdash;which come twice in every month,
once when the moon is new and once when it
is full&mdash;the waves retreat much farther than they
do at other times. Then, if you go right down
to the water&#8217;s edge, you may often find creatures
which you will never meet with higher up on the
beach. And one of these is the sabre razor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span></p>


<h3>PLATE XX<br />

THE PINNA</h3>

<p>This is the largest of all the shell-bearing
molluscs which live in our British seas, for it
has been known to reach a length of nearly two
feet. It is found chiefly on our southern coasts,
and always lies upright, half buried in the mud
at the bottom of the water, with its shells partly
opened. And it always fastens itself down by
a bunch of &#8220;byssus&#8221; threads, like those of the
mussel, which are so strong that it takes a very
hard pull indeed to tear them away from their
hold.</p>

<p>In the British Museum you may see a pair of
gloves which have been made out of the byssus
threads of a pinna, and if these creatures were
more plentiful their threads would no doubt be
used in this way very largely indeed.</p>

<p>Now why do you think that the pinna always
rests at the bottom of the water with its shells
partly opened?</p>

<p class="caption">THE PINNA.</p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>Well, the reason is a very odd one. It is
setting a trap for fishes! For fishes, as perhaps
you know, are very inquisitive creatures. They
always want to know all about everything, and
whenever they see a hole they think that they
must find out what is inside it. So when a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
fish comes swimming past a pinna, and catches
sight of its gaping shells, it is almost sure to
venture in between them. Then the shells close
tightly, and it finds itself in a prison from which
there is no escape; and very soon it is killed and
devoured.</p>

<p>In colour, the shells of the pinna are very pale
brown, and a number of ridges run down it from
the smaller end to the larger. When the animal
is full-grown it is sometimes not at all easy to
see its shells, for they are covered almost all
over with barnacles and the tubes of sea-worms.</p>

CRABS</h2>
</div>

<h3>HOW CRABS GROW</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">IF you hunt about in the pools among the
rocks when the tide goes out, and look behind
the masses of sea-weeds which cover them,
you are quite sure to find a good many crabs of
several different kinds. Before I tell you about
these, however, I think you would like to know
something about the way in which these curious
creatures grow.</p>

<p>Remember, then, in the first place, that what
we always call the &#8220;shell&#8221; of a crab is not
really a shell at all. That is, it is not in the
least like the shell of an oyster, or a periwinkle,
or a cowry, or a whelk. In these creatures the
shell grows together with the animal inside it,
and is never thrown off all through their lives.
But the &#8220;shell&#8221; of a crab never grows at all.
It is really a kind of crust of lime on the outside
of the skin, which will not even stretch
in the very least degree. So the only way in
which crabs can grow is by throwing off their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
&#8220;shells,&#8221; in order that the soft bodies underneath
may increase in size.</p>

<p>So once in every year, until it reaches its full
size, every crab has to cast off its shelly covering
and get a new one in its place. A few days
before the change takes place it always goes
and hides away in some dark crevice among the
rocks, or behind an overhanging mass of sea-weed,
where none of its many enemies are likely
to find it. It knows perfectly well, you see, that
while it is without its coat of mail it will be
quite helpless; for its claws will be so soft that
it will not be able to use them, while its body
will be quite unprotected. Then a very strange
thing indeed takes place. Something like a
third part of its flesh turns into water! If you
were to catch the animal at this time and to
shake it, you would be able to hear the water
swishing about inside its shell! Then it gets
very restless indeed, and begins to wriggle about
a good deal, turning and twisting from side to
side, and rubbing its legs against one another,
till it is quite tired out. It then rests for a little
while, and begins to wriggle and twist about
again. The fact is that it is trying to get loose,
as it were, inside its &#8220;shell.&#8221; After a time it
succeeds in doing this, so that the &#8220;shell&#8221; is
no longer fastened to its body at all. Then,
quite suddenly, a rent opens right across its
back, and the crab gathers itself together and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
leaps, with a mighty effort, right out of its old
coat! And as soon as it has done so the rent
closes up again, so that unless you look very
carefully indeed you cannot see it. You might
really think that two crabs were lying side by
side together.</p>

<p>For about a couple of hours the crab now lies
perfectly still; and if you were to feel it you
would find that its body was hard and knotted
all over. That is because its muscles are cramped
after the violent efforts which it has been making.
After a time, however, the cramp passes off.
Then the animal begins to grow. It grows
very fast indeed. In fact it grows so fast that
you can almost see it growing, and in less than
twenty-four hours it is sometimes nearly half
as big again as it was before. A new &#8220;shell&#8221;
then begins to form upon the skin, and in about
a couple of days more the animal is able to leave
its retreat, clothed once more in a suit of good
stout armour.</p>

<p>That is the way in which crabs, and lobsters,
and shrimps, and prawns all grow. Once in
every year at least they get new &#8220;shells&#8221;; and
every time that they do so they increase in size.
But after they reach a certain age they grow
no more; and the coats of mail which they are
wearing then are kept to the end of their lives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span></p>


<h3>HOW CRABS SEE</h3>

<p>Perhaps, too, you would like to know something
about the eyes of crabs; for these creatures
see in a very odd way. On each side of
the head is a kind of stalk, something like those
which you may see on the heads of slugs and
snails, only very much smaller. And at the tip
of each stalk is a small black spot. Now if
you were to put one of these little stalks under
the microscope, and to look at the black spot,
you would find that it was made up of hundreds
and hundreds of very tiny eyes, very much like
those of insects, except that instead of being
six-sided they are square. So that altogether,
perhaps, a crab may have three or four thousand
eyes, or even more!</p>

<p>That sounds a very large number, doesn&#8217;t it?
But then, you see, a crab cannot move its eyes
up and down, and from side to side, as we can.
They are fixed, and cannot be moved at all.
Each eye, however, looks in rather a different
direction from all the rest. Some eyes look
upwards, some look downwards, some look forwards,
some look backwards, and some look
out on either side. So without moving its head
at all the crab is able to see all round it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>Think of it in this way.</p>

<p>Suppose that you take a telescope and look
through it. You can only see the objects at
which the telescope is pointed, not the objects
above it, or below it, or on each side. But if
you had four thousand telescopes, fastened together
in two bundles of a couple of thousand
telescopes each, all pointing in different directions,
<i>and if your eyes were made in such a way
that you could look through all the telescopes at
once</i>: then you would be able to see all round
you, though you would only be able to look in
any special direction through just one or two
of the telescopes.</p>

<p>Now that is very much like the way in which
the eyes of crabs are made. Each of these four
thousand eyes is really a kind of telescope. And
as they all point in different directions, the crab
is able to see above it and below it and on all
sides, though it only looks at any special object
through one or two eyes.</p>


<h3>HOW CRABS HEAR AND SMELL</h3>

<p>The way in which crabs hear and smell is
almost as curious as the way in which they see,
for they have very odd little ears and noses in
very odd places.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>On its head, as perhaps you know, a crab has
two pairs of feelers. We call them the &#8220;lesser
feelers&#8221; and the &#8220;greater feelers.&#8221; Now if you
were to look at the first joint of the lesser
feelers through a good microscope, you would
find on each a little gland, or bag, containing
a very tiny drop of salt and water. These
are the crab&#8217;s ears. Of course they are not
nearly so good as our ears are. Indeed, I do
not think that a crab can hear sounds in the
air at all. But water carries sounds much
more readily than air does, so that if you were
to dive into a lake, or into the sea, on a calm,
still day you could easily hear the beat of the
oars in a boat half a mile away. And the ears
of the crab are made in such a way that they
can hear sounds in the water quite well,
even though they may be deaf to sounds in
the air.</p>

<p>Then if you look at the first joint of the greater
feelers through the microscope, you will see two
other tiny glands. These are the crab&#8217;s noses,
by which it can smell odours in the water just
as we can smell odours in the air. It always
seems to find its food by scent, and if one of
those basket-like traps which we call crab-pots
is baited with a few pieces of decaying fish and
lowered into the sea, crabs will smell the bait
from quite a long distance away, and come
hurrying up to obtain a share in the banquet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
And they seem to do so by means of those odd
little noses on the lower joints of their greater
feelers.</p>


<h3>PLATE XXI<br />

THE EDIBLE CRAB</h3>

<p>Now let me tell you something about the
different kinds of crabs which you may find on
the shore.</p>

<p>First of all, of course, there is the Edible Crab.
This is the crab which is so largely used for
food, and which you may see in any fishmonger&#8217;s
shop. Sometimes it grows to a very great size,
and has claws so big and strong that if it were
to seize a man by the wrist he would find it
very difficult indeed to set himself free. You
will not find crabs as big as this among the
rocks, for these giant creatures always live in
rather deep water. But one often discovers a
crab four or five inches across hiding in a rock-pool,
and even he is quite big and strong enough
to give one a very sharp nip.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="chapter">
<p class="ph1"><a id="plate21"><span class="smcap">Plate XXI</span></a></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_064.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE EDIBLE CRAB.</p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>It is rather amusing to get one of these crabs
out on to the open sand, and then to stand just
in front of him. He will at once raise both his
great claws and hold them in readiness to strike
at you if you attempt to seize him. Then if you
walk slowly round and round him he will turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
round and round too, so as to keep facing you,
over and over and over again. And if you put
your hand anywhere near him he will snap at it
so quickly that it is really not at all easy to avoid
his stroke.</p>

<p>Edible crabs often have their shells covered
with barnacles and the tubes of some of the sea-worms.
Old crabs, indeed, which no longer
change their coats of mail every year, are often
so covered with these creatures that one can
hardly see their shells at all.</p>


<h3>PLATE XXII<br />

THE SHORE CRAB (1)</h3>

<p>This is sometimes known as the Green Crab,
because it is generally more or less green in
colour. But you may often find examples, which
are deep brown all over, while others are bright
yellow, with black markings upon their backs.
It does not grow to nearly such a great size
as the edible crab, and although its flesh is quite
good to eat there is so little of it that the animal
is hardly ever used for food. But it is wonderfully
strong, and if you find a green crab hiding
beneath a big stone or behind a mass of sea-weed,
you must be very careful not to get a nip
from its claws.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>The green crab spends a great part of its life
out of the water, for its gills are made in such
a manner that they will keep moist for a very
long time. And as long as its gills are damp a
crab can breathe quite as easily on land as if it
were in the sea. It is very active, and if you go
down near the water&#8217;s edge while the tide is coming
in you may often see it hunting sandhoppers
and even flies, creeping up to them very carefully
until it is only a few inches away, and then pouncing
upon them so suddenly that they have no
time to escape. And it is often very troublesome
to fishermen, for it will seize their bait with its
strong nippers, and pull it off the hooks before
a fish is able to take it.</p>

<p>This crab is very easily kept in confinement,
and will soon become quite tame, so that it will
even come and take food from your fingers just
like a dog. But you must be careful to pile up
a few stones in the water in which you keep it,
so that it may sit upon them and take an airing
whenever it feels inclined. And it will even enjoy
an occasional run about the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span></p>


<h3>PLATE XXII<br />

THE FIDDLER CRAB (2)</h3>

<p>The crabs about which I have been telling
you live in the sea, though they often leave it
for some little time and run about on the shore.
But none of them can swim, and if they are
thrown into deep water they just sink to the
bottom with their legs sprawling, feeling about
for some object to which they can cling. Sometimes,
however, if you look into one of the pools
which are left among the rocks when the tide
goes down, you may see a small crab swimming
through the water with some little speed. This
is quite sure to be a Fiddler Crab, and if you
catch it and examine its hinder legs, you will find
that instead of being quite slender, with hooked
claws at the tips, as they are in most crabs,
they are flattened out into broad, oval plates.
And you will also find that these plates have
a fringe of rather long hairs growing all round
them.</p>

<p>Now these are the paddles with which the
crab rows itself through the water, and it is
called the &#8220;Fiddler Crab&#8221; because the movements
which it makes with them are rather like
those of a man who is playing the violin. You
can easily keep it in an aquarium, and a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
interesting little pet it makes. But you must
remember that it is a very savage little animal,
and will certainly do its best to kill any other
creatures that you may put into the same vessel.
Even if you put two fiddlers together they are
almost sure to fight; and the one which wins the
battle will kill and eat the one which loses it.</p>

<p>When the Fiddler Crab is alive it is really a
very handsome little creature, for its blackish
shell is covered all over with soft, short down,
looking rather like velvet, while its legs are
striped with blue, and its claws are partly blue
and partly scarlet.</p>


<h3>PLATE XXIII<br />

THE MASKED CRAB (1)</h3>

<p>The broad shelly shield which covers the back
of a crab is called the &#8220;carapace,&#8221; and there are
certain markings upon it which are rather like
the features of a human face. But there is one
crab in which these markings are so deep and
strong that it looks just as if it were wearing a
mask. So it is always known as the &#8220;Masked
Crab.&#8221; It is found on the southern and western
shores of England and Wales, and you may
always know it if you meet with it, not only
because of the face-like markings upon its back,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
but also because its carapace is a good deal
longer than it is broad, whereas in other crabs it
is nearly always broader than it is long. Besides
this, the great claws are not really &#8220;great&#8221; at
all, for they are very long indeed and very slender,
with quite small nippers at the tips, while the
greater feelers are quite as long as the claws.
So altogether the masked crab is a very odd-looking
crab indeed. But if you want to find
it you will have to look for it very carefully,
for it has an odd way of burying itself in the sand,
and only leaving just its feelers and its eyes above
the surface.</p>


<h3>PLATE XXIII<br />

THE THORNBACK CRAB (2)</h3>

<p>This is perhaps the very oddest of all our
British crabs.</p>

<p>In the first place, it looks much more like a
big spider than a crab; for its body is very small,
while its legs are very long and very slender.
Indeed, the group of crabs to which it belongs
is often called &#8220;spider crabs&#8221; in consequence.
In the second place, its carapace is covered all
over with rather long sharp spikes, which project
in all directions, so that it strongly reminds one
of a tipsy-cake! And, in the third place, the crab<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
nearly always has a number of tufts of sea-weed
or sponge growing upon its back.</p>

<p>Perhaps you might think that these come
there by accident. But they do not. The crab
himself plants them there! If you keep him in
an aquarium you may often see him doing so.
First of all he turns one of his long claws over
his back and scratches away at the carapace,
so as to roughen the surface. Then he pulls up
a little sprig of sea-weed or sponge and actually
plants it on his shell, pressing the rootlets firmly
down. And besides the spikes upon the shell
there are numbers of tiny hooks, which help to
hold it in position. Then the crab plants another
piece of weed or sponge in just the same way,
and so he goes on planting piece after piece
until his back is completely covered.</p>

<p>Now why do you think he takes all this trouble?</p>

<p>Well, the reason is that he does not want to
be seen; for he has a great many enemies, and
he knows perfectly well that if he were to lie
among the sea-weeds or sponges at the bottom
of the sea they would be quite sure to notice
him as they passed by, and then he would almost
certainly be killed and eaten. So he clothes
himself with either sea-weeds or sponges, as the
case may be, and then feels that he is perfectly
safe, and that as long as he keeps quite still even
the sharpest eye will fail to notice him. And if
you catch one of these crabs which is covered with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
sea-weeds and put it into an aquarium in which
sponges are growing, it will very soon strip
the weeds off its back and cover itself with
sponges instead; while if you catch one that is
covered with sponges, and put it into a tank in
which sea-weeds are growing, it will strip off
the sponges and cover itself with sea-weeds!</p>

<p class="caption">1. THE MASKED CRAB.<span class="gap">2. THE THORNBACK CRAB.</span></p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>The thornback crab often grows to a rather
large size. Indeed, next to the edible crab, it
is the largest of all the crabs which are found
in our British seas, for its carapace is sometimes
as much as eight inches long and six inches
wide, while its great claws may be fourteen or
fifteen inches in length. On some parts of the
coast it is used for food, but its flesh is rather
coarse and of poor quality.</p>


<h3>PLATE XXIV<br />

THE LONG-BEAKED SPIDER CRAB (1)</h3>

<p>This crab has an even smaller body in proportion
to its size than the thornback, and its
legs are so very long and so very slender that
they remind one of those of a daddy-long-legs.
Its carapace is drawn out in front into a kind
of beak, which is quite as long as the carapace
itself, and while the crab is alive it is of a most
beautiful pink and puce colour. It is not a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
common creature, but is sometimes to be found
in the rocky pools near low-water mark on our
southern coasts, and is covered, very often, with
sea-weeds or sponges, just like the thornback.</p>


<h3>PLATE XXIV<br />

THE FOUR-HORNED SPIDER CRAB (2)</h3>

<p>Perhaps this is the commonest of the British
spider crabs. Indeed, it is so plentiful at Bognor,
and at other places on the southern coast of
England, that when a crab pot is taken out of
the water as many as twenty or even thirty of
these creatures are sometimes found in it. They
are called by the fishermen &#8220;sea-spiders,&#8221; and
are generally so clothed with those odd sea-weeds
called &#8220;corallines&#8221; that you can hardly see any
part of their &#8220;shells&#8221; at all.</p>

<p>In this crab the carapace is drawn out in front
into a very long beak indeed, which has four
horns upon it, and the whole upper surface is
covered with short, sharp spikes and stout hairs.</p>

<h3>PLATE XXV<br />

THE PEA CRAB (1)</h3>

<p>This is a very odd crab indeed. In the first
place it is extremely small. Even when it reaches
its full size it is scarcely ever so much as half-an-inch
across, while its body is so round that
it really does remind one very much of a pea.
Only it is not quite the right colour for a pea,
for it is creamy yellow instead of green.</p>

<p>And, in the second place, this crab lives in
a very odd place&mdash;namely, inside the shells of
living mussels, or pinnas, or even cockles! What
it does there nobody seems quite to know. It
does not appear to injure the animal to whom
the shell belongs, although it is very fond of
the flesh of mussels, and if it finds one of those
creatures lying dead will certainly devour it.
Perhaps it only creeps inside its shell for the
sake of safety. At any rate, it is a very timid
little crab, and if you open a mussel and find a
pea crab lying hidden inside it, it will tuck up
all its legs quite close to its little round body
and lie perfectly still for several minutes in the
hope that you will think that it is dead.</p>

<p>On some parts of the coast pea crabs are so
plentiful, that three out of four mussels are found
to have one of these odd little creatures inside it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span></p>


<h3>PLATE XXV<br />

CRAB CATERPILLARS (2 and 2 <span class="allsmcap">A</span>)</h3>

<p>I dare say you did not know that crabs have
caterpillars, just as insects have. We call these
crab caterpillars &#8220;zoeas,&#8221; and they are not in
the least like their parents. There are a great
many different kinds, of course, for every crab
has its own zoea, just as every butterfly and
moth has its own caterpillar, and some of them
are not very much like some of the others. But
they are always very tiny indeed&mdash;they are scarcely
as large, in fact, as the smallest grains of sand&mdash;and
they always have a very long curved horn
in front of the body and another one behind,
and long waggly tails. And they swim in the
oddest way possible&mdash;by turning somersaults in
the water, over and over again!</p>

<p>These zoeas are very useful little creatures,
because they feed upon the tiny scraps of decaying
matter which are always floating about in
the sea, and so help to keep the water always
pure. They belong, in fact, to the great army
of what I always like to call &#8220;nature&#8217;s dustmen&#8221;&mdash;those
little animals whose duty it is to clear
away the rubbish from the world. There are
millions and millions of these busy little workers
on the land, and millions and millions of others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
in ponds and rivers, as well as in the sea, and
so well do they perform their task that both the
air and the water are always kept pure.</p>

<p>Another very interesting fact about zoeas is
that they form the chief food of no less a creature
than the Greenland whale. No doubt you know
that whales are of two kinds&mdash;those which have
teeth, and those which have none. Those which
have teeth feed upon fishes, and giant cuttles,
and could easily swallow a man. But the whales
which have no teeth have throats so small that
they would almost certainly be choked if they
tried to swallow a herring! So they have to
feed on very small creatures indeed, and are
very fond of zoeas, which often swim about in
such vast shoals that the water of the sea is
quite thick with them. And they catch them in
a most curious manner.</p>

<p>You have heard, of course, of the very useful
substance which we call &#8220;whalebone;&#8221; and no
doubt you know that it has nothing to do with
the bones of the whale at all. It is found in the
mouths of those whales which have no teeth,
and hangs down in great plates from the gums
of their upper jaws. Very soon these plates split
up; and then each part splits up again; and so
on, over and over again, till at their lower ends
they form a kind of thick fringe of close, matted
hairs.</p>

<p>Now it is by means of this fringe that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
whale catches the zoeas. When it meets with
a shoal of these little creatures it opens its huge
mouth wide, and swims through them. Then it
nearly closes its jaws, and lets down the whalebone
plates, so that the hairy fringe forms a
kind of strainer all the way round. It then
squirts out the water from its mouth through
this fringe, which allows the water to pass
through it, but keeps back the zoeas; and when
it has got rid of all the water it closes its mouth
completely and swallows the zoeas, a few thousand
at a time, after which it opens its jaws again,
and swims through the shoal once more.</p>

<p>Doesn&#8217;t it seem strange that the biggest animal
on earth should feed on some of the very
smallest?</p>

CRAB CHRYSALIDS (3 and 3 <span class="allsmcap">A</span>)</h3>

<p>When the caterpillar of an insect has reached
its full size it throws off its skin and appears
as a chrysalis, or pupa. And the caterpillar, or
zoea, of a crab does exactly the same thing. It
casts its skin, and appears in quite a different
form. Only we do not call it a chrysalis, as a
rule. We call it a &#8220;Megalopa.&#8221;</p>

<p>The word &#8220;megalopa&#8221; means &#8220;a creature with
big eyes,&#8221; and it is given to the crab chrysalis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
because it has eyes which are enormously big
in proportion to the size of the head. They are
set on long footstalks, which project on either
side, so that the head looks rather like a hammer.
Then the long curved horns which the zoea had
are to be seen no longer, and the carapace is
shaped much more like that of the perfect animal,
while the great claws begin to show, and the
legs increase in length. The tail, however, is
still quite free, like that of a lobster, and the
little animal still swims by turning somersaults
in the water, and lives on the same tiny scraps
of decaying matter on which it fed as a zoea.
After a few weeks it throws off its skin once
more, and appears in the world as a perfect
crab.</p>


<h3>PLATE XXVI<br />

HERMIT CRABS (1 and 2)</h3>

<p>If you go down among the rocks when the
tide is out, and hunt about in the pools, you may
often find the shell of a whelk in which a small
crab is living, with one of his great claws
carefully guarding the entrance. This is a Hermit
Crab, and a very curious little creature he is.
For, in the first place, his long tail is quite free,
like that of a lobster, instead of being fastened
down to the lower surface of his body; and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
the second place, it is quite soft, without any
shelly covering at all. His body and limbs are
covered with armour, just like those of other
crabs, but his tail has none at all.</p>

<p>The consequence is that the hermit crab always
has to take the very greatest care of his tail.
He is so dreadfully afraid that one of his many
enemies will come up behind and give it a nip
when he isn&#8217;t looking! So he protects it by
tucking it away into the empty shell of a whelk.
He never leaves this shell, but drags it about
with him wherever he goes. And if you take
hold of him and try to pull him out, you will
find that you cannot do so without injuring him
very badly. For at the end of his tail he has a
pair of strong pincer-like organs, with which he
holds on so firmly that it is very difficult indeed
to make him let go.</p>

<p>Indeed, the only way to get a hermit crab out
of his dwelling is to put him, shell and all, into
the spreading arms of a big sea anemone. That
frightens him almost out of his wits, for the
arms of the anemone at once come closing in,
and he knows quite well that if he stays where
he is he will very soon be swallowed. So he
skips out of the shell and scampers away as
fast as he possibly can, leaving the empty shell
in the anemone&#8217;s clutches.</p>

<p class="caption">1. THE HERMIT CRAB IN WHELK-SHELL.<br />

2. THE HERMIT CRAB OUT OF SHELL.</p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>The poor little animal is now perfectly miserable.
He has no protection for his tail, you see,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
and goes hunting about everywhere for some
other shell into which he can tuck it. After a
while, perhaps, he finds that of a periwinkle.
It is not of much use, of course, for it is so
small that he can only get just the tip of his
tail into it. Still, it is better than nothing, and
he goes crawling about with the periwinkle shell
on the end of his tail, like a thimble on the tip
of one&#8217;s finger, in search of a bigger one. By-and-by
he discovers one. Then he whips his
tail out of the old shell and into the new one
so quickly that you can hardly see how he does
it, and goes off to look for a bigger shell still.
And in this way he will change his dwelling
perhaps half-a-dozen times before he is really
satisfied.</p>

<p>Sometimes you may find a hermit crab with
a sea anemone fastened to the edge of the shell
in which he is living. That seems strange,
doesn&#8217;t it, when you remember how terribly
afraid the little animal is of anemones. But in
such a case the anemone never interferes with
the hermit crab, and the crab never interferes
with the anemone, while both of them benefit
by the arrangement. The crab benefits, because
no fish will ever touch him so long as an
anemone is attached to his whelk-shell. There
are plenty of fishes which would be quite ready
to gobble him up, whelk-shell and all, if it were
not for this creature. But fishes know quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
well that sea anemones can sting, and therefore
never think of devouring them, no matter
how hungry they may be; so that so long as
an anemone is guarding the whelk-shell in which
he lives, the hermit knows that he is perfectly
safe. And the anemone benefits, because it gets
a share of the crab&#8217;s meals. When a hermit
crab finds the dead body of some small creature
at the bottom of the sea he pulls it to pieces
and devours it; and as he does so a quantity of
tiny scraps are sure to come floating upwards,
and are seized by the outspread arms of the
anemone. So the crab gets the big pieces, and
the anemone gets the little ones; and both are
perfectly satisfied.</p>

LOBSTERS AND THEIR KIN</h2>
</div>

<h3>PLATE XXVII<br />

THE LOBSTER</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">YOU are not at all likely to catch a lobster
for yourself, for these creatures live in deep
water, and are only to be taken by means of
proper lobster-pots. But I must not pass the
animal by without mentioning it at all, for at
any rate you will be quite sure to see it on
the slab of every fishmonger&#8217;s shop.</p>

<p>Of course you know that a lobster is not red
until it is boiled, but is nearly black all over.
And of course you know, too, that one of its
great claws is always a good deal larger and
stouter than the other. Sometimes people think
that the reason of this is that at some previous
time the animal had lost one of his claws through
some accident, and was growing a new one, and
that the new limb had not yet had time to reach
its full size. However, this is not the case, for
one claw of a lobster is always a good deal bigger
than the other; and the real reason is that the
two claws are used for different purposes. The
larger claw is a weapon, with which the animal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
fights, while the smaller one is an anchor, with
which he clings to the weeds which grow on
the rocks at the bottom of the sea. And very
often one is quite twice as big as the other.</p>

<p>Now I wonder whether you know how a lobster
uses his tail. He employs it in swimming, and
if you look at it you will find that it is made of
several broad, flat plates, which can be spread
out very much like the joints of a fan. You will
notice, too, that these joints have a fringe of
hairs growing all round them. Now when a
lobster swims he just stretches his body straight
out, and then doubles it suddenly up. As he
does so the plates of the tail spread out, and
form a kind of very broad and powerful oar,
which strikes the water with such force as to
drive the animal swiftly backwards. With a
single stroke of its tail, indeed, a lobster can
dart to a distance of forty or fifty feet, and that
so quickly that even the swiftest fishes could
scarcely overtake him.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, a lobster swims forwards;
and he does this by means, not of his tail, but
of five pairs of odd little organs underneath the
tail, which we call &#8220;swimmerets.&#8221; They spring
from either side of the soft hinges by which
the joints of the tail are fastened together, and
each consists of two thin oval plates fringed with
long hairs. So each swimmeret really consists
of two tiny paddles, and by waving them to and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
fro in the water the lobster manages to travel
along with some little speed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="chapter">
<p class="ph1"><a id="plate27"><span class="smcap">Plate XXVII</span></a></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_082.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE LOBSTER.</p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>These swimmerets are used for another purpose
as well, however, for the mother lobster always
glues her eggs to the hairs with which they are
fringed, and carries them about with her for some
little time. Haven&#8217;t you noticed, when you have
had shrimps for tea, that a good many of them
had clusters of eggs underneath their bodies?
Well, if you had put one of those shrimps under
a microscope, and examined it very carefully,
you would have found that every one of the eggs
was firmly glued down to one of the hairs on
its swimmerets, where it would have remained
until it was hatched. And lobsters carry their
eggs about with them in just the same way.</p>


<h3>PLATE XXVIII<br />

THE PRAWN (1)</h3>

<p>If you go down among the rocks when the
tide is out, and look into the shallow pools which
have been left among them by the retreating
waves, you are quite sure to see numbers of
shadowy forms darting to and fro through the
water. A good many of these will be prawns,
and if you catch one or two of them in a small
net, and examine them carefully, you will find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
that they are very much like tiny lobsters.
Indeed, if you could magnify a prawn to the
size of a lobster, or reduce a lobster to the size
of a prawn, it really would not be very easy to
tell the one from the other.</p>

<p>But you will be surprised to see how different
live prawns look from the dead ones which you
may see in a fishmonger&#8217;s shop. The fact is
that, like the lobster, they change colour when
they are boiled. When they are alive, indeed,
they hardly have any colour at all, and are nearly
transparent. That is why it is so difficult to
see them in the water. And if you keep them
in an aquarium, all that you can see of them,
very often, as they dart to and fro is just their
glowing eyes, which gleam in the water like
tiny balls of fire.</p>

<p>There are two facts about prawns which I am
sure you will be interested to know.</p>

<p>The first is that they are extremely useful
little creatures, for they feed upon the bodies
of the various small animals which die in the sea,
and so prevent them from becoming putrid and
poisoning the water. And the second is that
they always take the greatest possible care to
keep themselves clean. If you take a few live
prawns home, and put them in an aquarium,
you may often see them performing their toilets.
Their front legs are covered with stiff little hairs
which stand out at right angles, so that these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
limbs really form a pair of brushes. And with
them the prawn will clean its body most diligently,
rubbing itself all over until every little
speck of dirt has been removed. And if any
object should cling to its body which these tiny
brushes cannot rub away, it will pull it off by
means of the strong little pincers on the second
pair of legs.</p>

<p>Do you want to know how to tell a prawn
from a shrimp?</p>

<p>Well, all that you have to do is to look in front
of its head. There, projecting from the edge
of the &#8220;carapace,&#8221; or shield which covers the
back, you will see a long spike, something like
a beak. Just put your finger upon this, and
feel the edge. If it is set with sharp little teeth,
like those of a saw, the animal is a prawn. But
if the spike is perfectly smooth, it is a shrimp.</p>


<h3>PLATE XXVIII<br />

THE &AElig;SOP PRAWN (2)</h3>

<p>This is a much prettier creature than the
common prawn, for its transparent body is
covered with scarlet lines, while its long thread-like
feelers have rings of the same colour round
them at regular distances apart. It is called
the &#8220;&AElig;sop&#8221; prawn because it has a big hump<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
on its back, just like the writer of the famous
fables.</p>

<p>If you want to catch an &AElig;sop prawn you must
look for it in the summer, for it always spends
the rest of the year in deeper water. But as
soon as the weather becomes really warm it
travels up and down with the tide, and you may
find it in plenty in the pools which are left among
the rocks at low-water.</p>


<h3>PLATE XXVIII<br />

THE SHRIMP (3)</h3>

<p>I told you that a good many of the shadowy
forms which you may see darting to and fro in
the rock-pools are those of prawns. The rest
are quite sure to be shrimps, which are very
much more common. Indeed, in most of the
rock-pools you will find at least ten shrimps for
every prawn. But they are very difficult to see,
for they are partly transparent when they are
alive, so that they are scarcely visible when they
are swimming. And when they are resting at
the bottom of the pool their speckled bodies
look almost exactly like the sand on which
they lie. Besides this, they have a way of nearly
burying themselves, by scooping out a kind of
furrow with their hind limbs, sinking into it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
and then covering themselves with sand by means
of their feelers. So the fishermen often call them
&#8220;sand-raisers.&#8221;</p>

<h3>PLATE XXIX<br />

THE SANDHOPPER (1 and 1 <span class="allsmcap">A</span>)</h3>

<p>Commoner even than the shrimps are the Sandhoppers.
On any sandy part of the shore you
may find them in thousands and thousands. If
you walk along the beach where the sand is dry,
and step rather heavily, you will see their holes
opening all round you. If you walk along it where
it is damp, you will find that it is honeycombed
with their burrows. If you turn over a stone,
or lift up a piece of sea-weed which has been
thrown up by the waves, twenty, or thirty, or forty
of them will come skipping out like so many
tiny kangaroos. And if you walk near the edge
of the water when the tide is coming in you
may often see them leaping about in such vast
numbers that they look just like a thick mist
rising for a foot or eighteen inches into the air.</p>

<p>Yet sandhoppers have so many enemies that
it really seems wonderful that any of them should
be left alive at all. Nearly all the shore birds
feast upon them, and so do many of the land
birds. Indeed, when the tide is rising, you may
often see a long line of birds standing closely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
side by side together a few feet in front of the
water&#8217;s edge and gobbling up the active little
creatures in thousands. Then the shore crabs
are very fond of them, and destroy thousands
more. And even when they are buried deeply
in the sand they are not safe, for there is a little
beetle which goes down their burrows after them,
and catches and eats them there very much as
a ferret catches a rabbit in its hole.</p>

<p>But it is just as well that they do not all get
eaten, for sandhoppers are very useful little
creatures indeed. They feed upon the masses
of decaying sea-weed which are constantly flung
up on the shore by the waves. For they, too,
belong to the great army of &#8220;Nature&#8217;s Dustmen,&#8221;
like the &#8220;zoeas&#8221; of the crabs and lobsters, and
help to clear away all kinds of rubbish which
would poison the air and the water if it were
left to decay. Indeed, they will eat almost anything,
and if you were to tie up a number of sandhoppers
in your handkerchief, and leave them
there for a few minutes, you would never be able
to use the handkerchief again; for you would
find that their sharp little jaws had nibbled it
into holes.</p>

<p>If you watch a sandhopper carefully when it
is skipping about, you will find that it leaps by
doubling its body up, and then straightening it
out again with a sudden jerk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span></p>

<h3>PLATE XXIX<br />

THE SAND SCREW (2 and 2 <span class="allsmcap">A</span>)</h3>

<p>If you follow the tide as it goes out on a still
day, you will notice that it leaves the sand quite
smooth behind it. But if you come to the same
spot about half-an-hour later, you will often
find that it is marked by numbers of winding
tracks, which look just as if they had been made
by worms. These, however, are the work of the
Sand Screw, a curious little creature which in
many ways is very much like a sandhopper. But
instead of sinking its burrows almost straight
downwards into the sand, as sandhoppers do, it
drives them along almost as a mole does, just
below the surface.</p>

<p>If you stand quite still for a few minutes near
the water&#8217;s edge, when the tide is going out,
you may sometimes see this odd little creature
at work; for as it pushes its way along it raises
the sand into a kind of low tunnel, which generally
falls in behind it, and so forms a groove. And
if you suddenly turn over the sand in front of the
tunnel you will find the little animal which was
making it, and will see at once why it is called
the &#8220;sand screw.&#8221; For instead of skipping about
like a sandhopper, it will lie on one side and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
wriggle its way along with a curious &#8220;screwing&#8221;
movement, just as though it were trying to bore
its way into the sand.</p>


<h3>PLATE XXX<br />

ACORN SHELLS (1)</h3>

<p>If you examine the rocks which are left dry
when the tide goes out, you will often find that
they are covered almost all over with small shells
which look rather like those of tiny limpets.
Only at the top of each shell there is a little
hole, from the margin of which a number of ridges
run down to the bottom. And these ridges are
so sharp, that if you happen to slip when you
are wandering about among the pools, and catch
at a rock to save yourself, they will cut your
fingers almost as if they were knives.</p>

<p>These creatures are generally known as &#8220;Acorn
Shells,&#8221; and I dare say that you might think
that they must be very closely related to the
limpets. But in reality they are much more
closely related to the shrimps and sandhoppers,
though they look so very unlike them, and lead
such different lives. For while shrimps and sandhoppers
are always swimming or skipping about,
the little animals which live inside these acorn
shells never move at all after they are a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
days old, but spend their whole lives fastened
down to the surface of the rocks. But there is
this great difference between the two. When
the eggs of a limpet hatch, out come a number
of very tiny limpets, just like their parent in
everything except size. But when the eggs of
an acorn shell hatch, the little creatures which
come out from them are not like their parents
at all. They are &#8220;zoeas,&#8221; in fact, or acorn shell
caterpillars; and they do not reach their perfect
form for some little time.</p>

<p>When these little &#8220;zoeas&#8221; first make their
appearance in the world they are able to swim
about by means of three pairs of tiny feathery
legs, with which they paddle their way along
through the water. And they also have a round
black eye in the middle of the body, with which
they can see quite well. Every two or three
days they throw off their skins, just as caterpillars
do, and appear in new ones, which have been
gradually forming beneath. And each time that
they do this their shape changes. At last
they are ready to take their perfect form. Then
each of the little creatures clings to the surface
of a rock by means of its feelers, and pours
out a kind of cement, which hardens round
them, and anchors it firmly down. It then
throws off its skin once more, and appears in
the form of an acorn shell just like its parent.
And, strange to say, it throws off its eye at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
the same time, and is perfectly blind for the rest
of its life!</p>

<p>If you look down into a shallow pool, the rocky
sides of which are covered with these acorn
shells, you may often see a very pretty sight.
You may see the little animals fishing. Out
from the hole at the top of each shell comes a
kind of little net, which sweeps through the
water, and is then drawn back into the shell.
This net is really formed by the limbs, which
are fringed with long hairs, and as it passes
through the water it collects the little tiny
scraps of decaying matter on which the animal
feeds.</p>

<p>You may find these acorn shells in great
numbers, not only on the rocks which are left
dry when the tide goes out, but also on the
wooden beams which support piers and jetties.
Indeed, these beams are often so closely covered
with the odd little shells that you cannot see
the surface of the wood at all. And very often
they fasten themselves to the shells of limpets
and oysters, and even on the backs of crabs.</p>

<h3>PLATE XXX<br />

SHIP BARNACLES (2)</h3>

<p>These creatures are first-cousins, so to
speak, of the acorn shells, and they are called
&#8220;Ship Barnacles&#8221; because they are so very
fond of fastening themselves to the bottoms
of ships. Even after two or three months,
indeed, the hull of a vessel is often quite
covered with them below the water-line, and
they check her speed so greatly that she
has to be taken into dock to have them
scraped off before she can set out upon another
voyage.</p>

<p>You may generally find quite a number of
these barnacles on the pieces of timber which
are so often flung up by the waves after a
storm. And you will notice that each of them
grows, as it were, upon a kind of stalk, instead
of being fastened down to the surface
of the wood, as the acorn shells are upon
the rocks. This stalk consists of the pillar of
cement with which the little animal covered its
feelers just before it changed its form for the
last time.</p>

<p>There are a good many other kinds of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
barnacles, some of which are found in very odd
places. There is one, indeed, which always
lives on the backs of whales, and somehow
manages to sink itself quite deeply into their
skins!</p>

THE SEA WORMS</h2>

<h3>PLATE XXXI<br />

THE SEA MOUSE (1)</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">IF you go down among the rocks when the
tide is out, and hunt in the muddy pools near
low-water mark, you will be almost sure to find
a very odd-looking creature indeed. It is generally
between three or four inches long, and
although it is called a &#8220;Sea Mouse&#8221; it looks
very much more like a hairy slug; for its whole
body is covered with a matted coat of bristles.
But it is really a kind of sea worm. And it
looks just about as dull and dingy as any
creature can possibly be.</p>

<p>Yet in reality it is one of the most beautiful
animals which are found in the sea, and if you
want to see its beauty, all that you have to do
is to wash it. For the bristly coat which covers
its body is a kind of filter, which strains out
the mud from the water which passes to the
gills; and it soon becomes so choked with mud
that you cannot see what the animal is really
like at all. All that it wants, however, is a
really good bath: so just take it to a pool of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
clear sea-water, and rinse it thoroughly. Then
take it to another pool, and rinse it again.
Then take it to a third pool, and rinse it again;
and go on rinsing it till every atom of mud
has been washed out of its hairy coating. And
then, if you look at it in the bright sunshine,
I am quite sure that you will be astonished to
find what a lovely creature it really is. For all
the colours of the rainbow, and ever so many
more besides, seem to be chasing one another
over its bristles, and altering with every movement
and every change of light. Doesn&#8217;t it
seem strange that an animal so beautiful as
this should live with all its beauty covered up,
so that hardly any eye can ever see it?</p>

<p>But these bristles have another use besides
that of a filter. Each of them is really a kind
of long, slender spear with a barbed tip, which
can be used as a weapon of defence. If you
were to look at one of these bristly spears
through a good strong microscope you would
see that it was edged on both sides with sharp
little hooked teeth, looking very much like
those of a shark. But you need not be in the
least afraid to handle a sea mouse, for although
these slender spears look so formidable, they
are not nearly strong enough to pierce your
skin.</p>

<h3>PLATE XXXI<br />

THE SABELLA (2)</h3>

<p>A good many different kinds of worms live
on the sea-shore, and one of the most curious
of these is the Sabella. For it lives in long,
narrow tubes made of tiny grains of sand, which
it sticks together with a kind of natural glue.
You may find these tubes in great numbers
just about low-water mark, and hundreds and
hundreds of them are often twisted up together
in great masses, which are sometimes several
feet in diameter. The worms can travel up and
down these tubes by means of tufts of stiff little
bristles on each side of their bodies; and sometimes
they will leave them altogether, crawl
about on the sand for a little while, and then
make new ones. And if you keep them alive
in a glass vessel filled with sea-water, with a
little sand at the bottom, you can watch them
building their wonderful tubes, carefully choosing
grains of sand of just the proper size, arranging
them in position just as a bricklayer lays bricks,
and then sticking them firmly together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span></p>


<h3>PLATE XXXII<br />

THE SERPULA (1 and 2)</h3>

<p>If you look down into the pools among the
rocks when the tide is out you may often see
a number of long, twisted tubes fastened to the
surface of the stones at the bottom. These are
the dwellings of a very curious sea-shore worm
called the Serpula, and if you lift one of the
stones out of the water, and look down into the
tubes, you will nearly always see a bright scarlet
object lying just beneath the entrance. And then
you may be quite sure that the animal is alive.</p>

<p>Now suppose that you carry the stone home
with you, just as it is, and put it into a vessel
of sea-water. After an hour or two you will find
that the little scarlet objects have been poked
out of the tubes, and that they are really tiny
stoppers, just like little corks, which exactly fit
the entrance when they are pulled inside. And
you will also find that a plume of feathery objects,
which are also bright scarlet in colour, is projecting
out of the mouth of each tube. These
red plumes are the gills of the worms, and they
will often remain spread for hours at a time. But
if you startle the animals&mdash;if your shadow falls
upon them, for instance&mdash;they will draw themselves
down into their tubes in about half a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
quarter of a second, and every tube will be corked
up by its tiny stopper, just as before.</p>

<p class="caption">1. THE SERPULA.<span class="gap">2. SERPULAS IN TUBES.</span></p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>On the sides of its body the serpula has tufts
of little bristly hairs, just as the sabella has,
which allow it to move up and down its tube.
But in order to enable it to draw itself back as
quickly as possible in moments of danger, it has
a row of little hooked teeth on its back, by means
of which it can take a firm hold of the lining of
its burrow. I think you will be rather surprised
when I tell you how many of these teeth there
are in the row. Just fancy! Each serpula has
between thirteen and fourteen thousand!</p>

<p>If you look at the oysters in a fishmonger&#8217;s
shop, you may often see the tubes of these curious
worms fastened to the surface of the shells.</p>


<h3>PLATE XXXIII<br />

THE TEREBELLA (1)</h3>

<p>This is another of the worms which live in
tubes. You can generally find its wonderful little
dwellings by hunting in the small puddles of sea-water
which are left on the sands when the tide
goes out. And you can always tell them from
those of the sabella and the serpula by the curious
little fringe round the entrance, which is made
of the tiniest grains of sand fastened together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
into slender threads. The tube itself is made
of larger grains, and is so tough and leathery
that you can give it quite a hard pull without
breaking it. But as it is at least a foot long,
and is nearly always carried down underneath
rocks or big stones, you will not find it at all
easy to dig it up. And the moment that you
alarm the little animal inside it always makes
its way right down to the very bottom of its tube.</p>

<p>Sometimes a terebella will leave its tube and
go for a little swim in the pool, wriggling its
way through the water by first doubling its body
up and then stretching it out, over and over again.
But it very soon gets tired with its exertions,
and sinks down to the bottom of the pool to rest.
Then, after awhile, it will set busily to work,
and make a new tube to live in instead of the
old one.</p>

<p>There is another kind of terebella, called the
Shell-binder, which makes its tube of little bits
of broken shell instead of grains of sand. You
may find the ends of these tubes sticking up out
of the sand about half-way between high and
low-water mark. But they run down so deeply
that you will have to dig very hard indeed if
you want to get them out of the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span></p>


<h3>PLATE XXXIII<br />

THE LUG WORM (2)</h3>

<p>On any muddy stretch of beach, when the tide
is out, you may see numbers and numbers of
little twisted casts, just like those which you
may find on the lawn in the garden on any warm
damp morning. These are made by Lug Worms,
or &#8220;logs,&#8221; as the fishermen generally call them,
and they really consist of sand which the worm
has swallowed during the last three or four hours.
For lug worms burrow by swallowing mouthful
after mouthful of sand, until they can swallow
no more. They eat their way down into the sand,
in fact, just as earth-worms eat their way down
into the ground. And when their bodies are quite
filled with sand, they come up to the entrances
of their burrows and pour it out in the little twisty
coils which everybody who has walked on the
shore knows so well by sight.</p>

<p>If you take a spade and dig down into the
muddy sand you can find these worms in great
numbers. They are just about as big as earth-worms,
and are of all sorts of colours, some being
brown, and some dark green, and some purple,
and some crimson. But on each side of the body
they always have thirteen pairs of bright scarlet
tufts. These are the little gills by means of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
they breathe, and if you put them under a microscope
they look just like tiny bushes with brilliant
red leaves.</p>

<p>You would think, perhaps, that when a lug
worm bores its way through the loose sand,
the sides of its burrow would fall in behind it
as fast as it passed along. But from the surface
of its body it pours out a thin, sticky liquid
which binds the sand together, and forms a
kind of lining to the burrow, like the brickwork
of a railway tunnel. The burrow is generally
about two feet deep, and the worm always
lives in it with its head downwards. The worm
itself, when fully grown, is from six to ten inches
long.</p>


<h3>PLATE XXXIV<br />

THE NEMERTES (1)</h3>

<p>This is quite one of the most curious creatures
to be found on the sea-shore. It hides under
large stones at the bottom of the pools, and
looks rather like a tangled boot-lace. But it
is really a kind of leech-like worm, and the
wonderful thing about it is that it can stretch
its body out to almost any length, just as if it
were made of elastic. It always does this in
catching its prey, which it seizes by means of
its sucker-like mouth, which has a kind of beak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
inside it. Then it &#8220;plays&#8221; its victim just as
an angler &#8220;plays&#8221; a fish, sometimes stretching
its body out to a length of fifteen or twenty
feet, then drawing it in again to a length of
three or four, and so on over and over again,
until its prisoner is quite exhausted, when it
proceeds to devour it.</p>


<h3>PLATE XXXIV<br />

THE NEREIS (2)</h3>

<p>The Nereis is a very common sea-side worm,
and you can nearly always find it by turning
over the stones on the shore as the tide goes
out. It is brown in colour, with a dark red
line along the back; and if you look at it in
the sunlight you will see flashes of bright blue
playing over the surface of its skin. And underneath
it is of the most delicate pink, with a
glossy look which reminds one of mother-of-pearl.
It is one of the largest of all the worms,
for it often grows to a length of nearly two
feet.</p>

<p>If you examine the back of a nereis, you will
find a row of little tufted organs running right
along it. Each of these really consists of two
little flaps, which are folded together as long
as the worm remains still. But as soon as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
begins to swim they open out and wave up and
down in the water; for they are really tiny
paddles, by means of which the nereis rows
itself along. Altogether there are about four
hundred pairs of these little flaps, which move
in perfect time together, just like the oars of
a well-rowed boat. Perhaps you may have seen
a boat-race, and you noticed, no doubt, how all
the eight oars rose and fell exactly at the same
instant, as regularly as if they were moved by
machinery. Well, imagine a very long boat
indeed rowed by four hundred little rowers
instead of only by eight, and each with two
oars instead of one, and then you will have
some idea of what a nereis looks like as it goes
swimming through the water.</p>

<p>This curious worm does not live only under
stones, for it is sometimes found hiding in the
whelk shells which are occupied by hermit crabs,
the worm and the crab living in the same shell
together, and never seeming to interfere with
one another.</p>

STARFISHES</h2>
</div>

<h3>STARFISHES&#8217; LEGS</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">OF course you know starfishes very well indeed
by sight, for they are flung up in numbers
on the beach by almost every tide. But I
wonder if you know where their legs are!</p>

<p>Perhaps you did not know that they have any
legs. But they have hundreds and hundreds
of them. Only, instead of keeping their legs
outside their bodies, as we keep ours, starfishes
always keep them inside, and poke them out
through little holes in the skin when they are
required for use.</p>

<p>If you want to see the legs of a starfish, you
can very easily do so. First of all, you must
catch a starfish, and make quite sure that he
is alive. You can easily find out that by picking
him up. If his rays are quite limp and flabby,
and hang downwards from the disc, or middle
part of his body, so that they look rather like
the legs of a table, he is dead, and you can
throw him away. But if they stand out stiffly
he is alive. Then just put him into a pool of
sea-water, and wait. After a few minutes you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
are almost sure to see that he is moving. Very
slowly he begins to glide along the bottom of
the pool. If he comes to a stone, he glides
over it. If he comes to a rock, he glides up it.
Then, if you suddenly snatch him out of the
water, and turn him upside down, you will see
his legs&mdash;little white fleshy objects waving about
all over the lower surface of his body. And if
you look at them through a good strong magnifying-glass,
you will see that each one has a kind
of little cup at the end of a slender stem.</p>

<p>Now this cup is really a sucker, very much
like the suckers of a cuttle, only of course a
great deal smaller. And the starfish walks by
pushing one or two of its rays forward, taking
hold of the ground with the suckers underneath
them, and then pulling up the hinder rays and
taking hold with the suckers underneath those,
and so on over and over again.</p>


<h3>PLATE XXXV<br />

THE FIVE-FINGER STARFISH (1)</h3>

<p>This is by far the commonest of all the starfishes.
You can seldom walk for even a short
distance along the shore without seeing it.
And no doubt you might think that it must be
a very harmless creature indeed, for it does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
look as if it could injure any other animal in any
way at all. Yet it is really a creature of prey,
and feeds upon shell-bearing molluscs, such as
small bivalves, which it always swallows whole.
Then, when it has digested their bodies, it returns
their empty shells through its mouth. And it
can even eat such big creatures as mussels and
oysters. Indeed, starfishes are the very worst
enemies of the oyster-beds, and in one fishery
alone, on the coast of North America, they are
said to destroy more than ten thousand pounds&#8217;
worth of oysters every year!</p>

<p class="caption">1. THE FIVE-FINGERED STARFISH.<span class="gap">2. THE BIRD&#8217;S-FOOT STARFISH.</span></p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>A very strange fact about the starfish is that
if one of its rays is cut off, a new one very soon
grows in its place. Stranger still, if one of
these creatures is cut in two, each half begins
to throw out new rays, and in a few weeks&#8217;
time there are two starfishes instead of only
one! That seems impossible; doesn&#8217;t it? But
yet it is perfectly true.</p>

<p>And another very curious fact about starfishes
is that they keep their eyes in very odd places&mdash;at
the very tips of the rays. And in some
starfishes these eyes are furnished with lids,
which can be opened and shut!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span></p>


<h3>PLATE XXXV<br />

THE BIRD&#8217;S-FOOT STARFISH (2)</h3>

<p>This is a very curious starfish, and a very
handsome one as well. It is curious, because
its five rays are all joined together by membrane,
very much like the toes on a duck&#8217;s foot. That
is why it is called the &#8220;bird&#8217;s-foot&#8221; starfish.
And it is handsome, because it has a scarlet
centre, a scarlet line all round the margin, and
another one down the inner margin of each ray,
all the rest of the body being bright orange.</p>

<p>The bird&#8217;s-foot starfish is not very often seen,
for it lives some little way below low-water
mark. But sometimes, when there has been
a violent storm at a season of spring-tide&mdash;and
you will remember that spring-tides come whenever
there is a new moon or a full moon&mdash;it is
flung upon the beach by the retreating waves,
and you may find it lying on the sand when the
tide is out.</p>


<h3>PLATE XXXVI<br />

THE SUN STARFISH</h3>

<p>Sometimes you may find a very much larger
and handsomer starfish lying upon the shore.
It has twelve rays instead of five, and is often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
as much as eight or ten inches across. In fact,
it looks very much like a big sunflower. Generally
it is bright scarlet in colour, but just now
and then one finds a sun starfish with a violet
tinge; and sometimes, while the middle part
of the body is vermilion red, the rays are pale
rose-colour, or even pink.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="chapter">

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_108.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE SUN STARFISH.</p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>Like most of the starfishes, this animal has
a very curious way of protecting its eggs for
some little time after they are laid. It heaps
them all up together into a pile, and then bends
its rays downwards in such a way that it stands
upon their tips, looking just like a little table
with twelve very stout legs! It turns itself into
a sort of cage, in fact, with the eggs inside
it, and so guards them carefully until they
hatch.</p>


<h3>PLATE XXXVII<br />

THE BRITTLE STARFISH</h3>

<p>The Brittle Starfish is certainly the very oddest
of all odd creatures, for it not only grows
new rays if the old ones should be torn off, but
actually breaks itself into pieces if it is startled
or alarmed! And it is such a timid animal that
a slight touch, or even a shadow suddenly falling
upon it, will alarm it! Then it gives a kind
of shudder, and shatters itself into little bits,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
nothing being left but the central disc and a
heap of fragments! However, it does not appear
to suffer any pain, or to lose any blood, and the
five wounds on the disc very quickly heal. Then
after a few days five little buds begin to show
themselves, which quickly grow into new rays,
and in a few weeks&#8217; time the brittle starfish is
as perfect as ever!</p>

<p>So ready are these creatures to break themselves
up, that it is most difficult to obtain a
perfect brittle starfish for a museum.</p>

<p>Brittle starfishes are very active animals, and
when they are alive their long slender rays are
always wriggling and coiling and twisting about,
hardly ever seeming to be still for a single
moment. Indeed, one naturalist compares a
brittle starfish to five very long and active
centipedes stitched to a tiny pin-cushion!</p>

<p>There are several different kinds of these very
curious animals, most of which live at some little
distance below low-water mark, and are hardly
ever caught except by means of the dredge. But
sometimes you may find one of them lying on the
sand at the bottom of a pool among the rocks.</p>

<h3>PLATE XXXVIII<br />

THE SEA URCHIN (1 and 2)</h3>

<p>The &#8220;urchin,&#8221; as of course you know, is a
common country name for the hedgehog; and
the Sea Urchin is so called because it is covered
all over with long spikes, just as a hedgehog
is. These spines, however, are very easily broken
off, and when the animal dies, and its empty
shell is tossed to and fro by the waves, they are
knocked off in a very short time; so that when
you meet with a sea urchin&#8217;s shell lying upon
the shore you nearly always find that it is
covered with nothing more than hundreds of very
tiny pimples.</p>

<p>Now it is upon these little pimples that the
spines grow. If you were to examine one of the
spines with a magnifying-glass you would find
that its base was hollow. This hollow base is
just large enough to fit over one of the pimples,
to which it is fastened by a strong but rather
elastic muscle. So a sea urchin is able to move
its spines about quite freely. Indeed, it sometimes
walks with them as well as with the little
sucker-feet, which it pokes out through tiny
holes in the shell just as a starfish does, moving
a few forward at a time, and so hitching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
its way along over the sand at the bottom of
the sea.</p>

<p>If you succeed in finding a live sea urchin&mdash;and
you can generally do so without very much
trouble, by hunting in the pools among the rocks
when the tide is out&mdash;you will notice that it has
a very big mouth, with five perfectly enormous
teeth. They are so huge, indeed, that if you had
teeth as big, in proportion to your size, they would
be about as large as good big carving-knives!</p>

<p>On some parts of the coast sea urchins are
eaten as food, being scooped out of their shells
with a spoon, just as we eat a boiled egg at
breakfast. For this reason they are sometimes
known as &#8220;sea eggs,&#8221; and those who have tried
them say that they are very good indeed.</p>

<p>You would hardly think, perhaps, that a sea
urchin and a starfish could be related to one
another, for they do not look in the least alike.
But if you take an urchin which has lost its
spines, and examine it carefully, you will see
that it is really a kind of rolled-up starfish, and
you will be able to count its five rays quite easily.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is just one more thing that I must tell
you about these very curious creatures, and that
is that they are very fond of covering themselves
all over with small stones, and little bits of broken
shell, and tiny pieces of sea-weed, in order that
they may not be noticed. They do this in a very
odd way. I told you that they have numbers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
of little sucker-feet, which they poke out through
tiny holes in their shells when they are required
for use, just as the starfishes do. Well, when
they want to disguise themselves, they just push
out two or three hundred of these slender sucker-feet
between their spines, and take firm hold
with them of any small objects that may be lying
within reach. In this manner they soon succeed
in covering themselves all over, and you might
easily look at one of them as it lay at the bottom
of a rock-pool without recognising it at all.</p>

SEA CUCUMBERS AND
JELLYFISHES</h2>
</div>

<h3>PLATE XXXIX<br />

THE SEA CUCUMBER (1)</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">IF you grope about in the dark nooks and
corners of a rock-pool, quite close down to
the water&#8217;s edge, when the tide is out, you may
perhaps find a curious little creature which looks
rather like a greyish-white cucumber, with an
odd feathery tuft at one end of its body. This
is a Sea Cucumber, or Sea Gherkin, and is chiefly
remarkable because it seems to suffer very much
at times from eating something which does not
agree with it. Then it cures itself in a very odd
way indeed. It gets rid of almost all the inside
of its body, reducing itself to very little more
than an empty bag of skin, with just a little tuft
at one end! It throws off its teeth, it throws
off the lining of its throat, it throws off all its
digestive organs. You would think that it would
kill itself by doing this, wouldn&#8217;t you? But it
does not. And before very long new teeth, a
new throat lining, and new digestive organs grow
in the place of the old ones, so that in a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
weeks&#8217; time the animal is just as perfect as it was
before!</p>

<p>It seems rather hard to believe that an animal
can treat itself in such a manner as this, and
yet continue to live, doesn&#8217;t it? But remember
that &#8220;truth is stranger than fiction,&#8221; and that
some of the strangest animals of all are found
among those which live in the sea.</p>


<h3>PLATE XXXIX<br />

JELLYFISHES (2)</h3>

<p>Jellyfishes are among the very oddest creatures
which are found in the sea; for their bodies
are made up almost entirely of sea-water! It is
quite true, of course, that if you cut them in two
the water does not run away. But then if you
cut a cucumber in two the water does not run
away; and yet cucumbers are made almost
entirely of water. And the reason why it does
not run away is just the same in each case. Both
in the cucumber and in the jellyfish the water
is contained in a very large number of very tiny
cells; and if you cut either of them across you
only divide a very small number of the cells, so
that only a very small quantity of water escapes.
But if you leave a jellyfish lying on the beach
in the hot sunshine, and come back to look for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
it two or three hours later, you will not find it.
All that you will find will be a ring-shaped mark
in the sand, showing where the jellyfish had
been lying, with just a few threads of animal
matter in the middle. All the rest will have
evaporated, because it was nothing else but
water.</p>

<p>All the same, jellyfishes are very wonderfully
made; and perhaps the most wonderful thing
of all about them is the fringe of long, slender
threads which hangs down from the edges of
their bodies. For these are the fishing-lines by
means of which they catch their prey. Jellyfishes
feed on all sorts of tiny creatures&mdash;the fry of
fishes, and the zoeas of shrimps and prawns,
for instance&mdash;and if you were to see one of these
swim up against those terrible threads, you
would notice that it at once became paralysed,
and that in a very few moments it would be
dead. The fact is that all the way along these
threads are set with hundreds and hundreds of
tiny oval cells, each of which has a very slender
dart, with a barbed tip, coiled up like a watch-spring
inside it. And the cells are made in such
a way that as soon as they are touched they fly
open, and the little darts leap out. So, you see,
if any small creature swims up against the
threads numbers of darts at once bury themselves
in its body. And, as these darts are poisoned,
it dies in a very short time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>Jellyfishes can swim through the water by
spreading and contracting their umbrella-shaped
bodies, and you may sometimes see them travelling
about in such enormous numbers that the
water is perfectly thick with them.</p>


<h3>PLATE XL<br />

THE STINGING JELLYFISH (1)</h3>

<p>Sometimes, after a strong south-westerly wind
has been blowing for a day or two in the early
part of the autumn, you may find a brownish
yellow jellyfish lying upon the shore. It has a
circular body about as big as a soup-plate,
fringed all the way round with great masses
of long yellow hairs. And if you find one of
these creatures you are almost sure to find
another before very long, and then another, and
then another; for they nearly always swim
about in shoals together.</p>

<p>Now, if you do meet with one of these jellyfishes,
be very careful not to touch it with your
bare hands. And if you should happen to be
bathing, and to see one floating in the water
near you, just get out of its way as fast as you
possibly can. For those long yellow threads
which hang down from the margin of its body
sting just like nettles, and the least touch from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
them will cause a great deal of pain. If you
have a thin skin, indeed, the sting of this terrible
jellyfish may make you very seriously ill, and
several weeks may pass before the effects of
the poison pass away.</p>

<p>Yet the fishing-threads of this jellyfish are
scarcely thicker than hairs, and the little darts
which do so much mischief are so slender that
you cannot see them at all without the help of
a good strong microscope. Doesn&#8217;t it seem
strange that such tiny weapons can be so dreadfully
poisonous?</p>


<h3>PLATE XL<br />

THE SEA ACORN (2)</h3>

<p>This is a very common jellyfish indeed; yet
hardly anybody ever sees it. That is because
it is very small and very transparent, so that
as it swims about in the water it is almost
invisible. And if it is flung up on the beach
it dries up in a very few minutes. But if you
want to look at it, you can very easily do so.
On a warm, still day, when the sea is quite
smooth, just dip a small net into the water,
and work it gently to and fro. Then lift it out
and examine the sides carefully, and you are
almost sure to see three or four little lumps
of jelly, not much bigger than peas. These are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
sea acorns, and if you put them into a glass
vessel of perfectly clean sea-water, you will
very soon find that they are swimming about.
For though you cannot see the animals themselves,
which are quite as transparent as the
water, you will notice little flashes of coloured
light, sometimes blue, sometimes green, sometimes
yellow, and sometimes red, which just
gleam out for about half a quarter of a second,
and then disappear. You might almost think
that a tiny rainbow had been dissolved in the
water.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="chapter">

<p class="caption">1. THE STINGING JELLYFISH.<span class="gap">2. THE SEA ACORN.</span></p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>The fact is this. Running round the oval
body of the sea acorn are eight narrow bands,
and on each of these are a number of very tiny
scales, placed one above another, which keep
on rising and falling again, like so many little
trap-doors. These scales are really paddles, by
means of which the animal drives itself through
the water, and as they move up and down they
catch the rays of light and break them up, just
like that triangular piece of glass which we call
a &#8220;prism.&#8221; And though you cannot see the
jellyfish itself you can see these little flashes of
coloured light, and so can trace the course of
the little creature as it travels slowly along.</p>

<p>This curious jellyfish has only two fishing-threads,
which hang down from the lower part
of its body. But from each of these a number
of little side-threads spring out, just like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
&#8220;snoods&#8221; on the lines which fishermen use in
the sea. And the animal is always throwing
these out and drawing them in again, so that
it really &#8220;fishes&#8221; for the tiny little creatures on
which it feeds.</p>

SEA ANEMONES</h2>
</div>

<h3>HOW SEA ANEMONES ARE FORMED</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THE most beautiful of all the creatures which
live in the sea are undoubtedly the Sea
Anemones, which are just like living flowers of
all sorts of lovely colours. But I do not know
why they are called sea &#8220;anemones,&#8221; for they
are much more like asters, or dahlias, or
chrysanthemums.</p>

<p>These anemones are made in a very curious
way. You will notice, as you look down into
a rock-pool, that their soft fleshy arms, or
&#8220;tentacles,&#8221; are all spread out like the petals
of a flower. If you touch them, however,
they at once come closing in and disappear, so
that in two or three moments the creatures
look like mere lumps of coloured jelly. But if
you wait for a little while they will push out
their tentacles again, and spread them just as
before.</p>

<p>The fact is that the body of a sea anemone
is a kind of double bag. Suppose you take a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
paper bag, twist up the mouth, and push it
downwards, so that the sides of the bag surround
it all the way round. You will then have two
bags, as it were, one inside the other, the space
between the two being filled with air. Now
that is just the way in which the body of a sea
anemone is formed, with this difference, that
the space between the outer bag and the inner
one is filled with water. It forms, in fact, a
kind of water-jacket.</p>

<p>Next, remember that all those spreading tentacles
are really tubes, like the fingers of a glove,
closed at the top, but opening at the bottom into
this water-jacket. And remember also that the
outer walls of the body are formed of very strong
muscles. So, you see, when the anemone wants
to spread its tentacles, all that it has to do is
to contract these muscles. The water is then
squeezed up into the tube-like tentacles, which
of course expand. When it wants to close them
it relaxes the pressure, and the water flows out
of the tubes again and back into the water-jacket,
so that they all come folding in.</p>

<p>The lower part of an anemone&#8217;s body is called
the &#8220;foot,&#8221; and is really a big and strong sucker,
by means of which the animal clings so firmly
to the surface of a rock or a stone that it almost
seems to be growing out of it. But these creatures
do not spend the whole of their lives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
without moving, as oysters and barnacles do.
Sometimes they will creep slowly along over the
surface of the rock, in order to find a more comfortable
situation, or one where they will have
a better chance of catching prey. And sometimes
they will loose their hold of the rock
altogether, rise to the surface of the water, turn
upside down, and hollow their bodies in such a
way that they form little boats, which can float
along over the waves for quite a long distance.</p>


<h3>PLATE XLI<br />

THE SMOOTH ANEMONE (1)</h3>

<p>This is by far the commonest of all the sea
anemones, and you may find it in hundreds and
thousands by going down among the rocks when
the tide is out, and looking into the pools. You
are almost sure to see that their rocky walls
are dotted all over with lumps of brown or dark
green jelly, some only about as big as peas and
some as large as plums. These are Smooth
Anemones, with their fleshy feelers, or &#8220;tentacles&#8221;
closed. And just here and there you may see
one of them open, and you will notice that all
the way round the edge of its body, between
the roots of the tentacles, it has a row of little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
bead-like objects of the most beautiful turquoise
blue. For this reason the smooth anemone is
sometimes known as the &#8220;beadlet.&#8221;</p>

<p>You can easily keep these anemones in captivity,
for they are very hardy, and are no trouble at
all to feed. Indeed, they will go without any
food at all for three or four months together,
and seem all the better for their long fast. But
if you put a tiny dead crab, or a shrimp, or a
sandhopper, into the midst of their spreading
arms, you will see the tentacles close round it,
and push it down into the mouth, which lies
just in the very middle. For about forty-eight
hours the animal will then remain closed up.
But as soon as it has digested its dinner out
will come the tentacles again, bringing with them
the empty shell of the victim.</p>

<p>Every now and then, like other anemones, this
animal changes its skin, and when it leaves its
position on the side of a rock-pool and crawls
to a new one, it nearly always leaves a cast skin
behind it.</p>

<h3>PLATE XLI<br />

THE DAISY ANEMONE (2)</h3>

<p>This is not nearly such a common creature
as the smooth anemone, but you may sometimes
find it in the rock-pools at low-water on our
southern and western coasts. It is pale greyish
yellow in colour, and has an odd way of altering
its shape from time to time, so that sometimes
its body is long and slender, and sometimes it
is short and stout, while the disc may be long
and narrow one day, and almost round the next.
You can always tell it at once, if you should
happen to meet with it, by looking at its fleshy
feelers, or tentacles, which are marked with
rings of grey and white.</p>


<h3>PLATE XLII<br />

THE THICK-ARMED ANEMONE (1)</h3>

<p>Where the coast is sandy and rocky too this
anemone is often rather common. Yet very few
people ever see it, because it nearly always
fastens itself quite low down on the rocks which
border the pools, so that at least half of its body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
soon becomes covered up with sand. Besides
this, it has a great number of very tiny sucker-feet,
not unlike those of the starfishes and the
sea urchins, and with these it clings to tiny stones
and bits of broken shell, which often quite conceal
its upper surface, so that one really cannot see
the anemone itself at all. But it is quite one
of the very handsomest of all the British sea
anemones, for when it is fully grown it is over
five inches in width; and sometimes it is pearly
white in colour, and sometimes it is green, and
sometimes it is purple and brown, and sometimes
it is crimson, while its tentacles are banded with
scarlet and white. These tentacles are rather
stout in proportion to their length, and when
they are fully spread the animal looks very much
like a cactus dahlia.</p>


<h3>PLATE XLII<br />

THE SNAKE-LOCKED ANEMONE (2)</h3>

<p>This is also one of the prettiest of these very
pretty creatures. But it is not in the least like
the thick-armed anemone, for instead of having
a broad, stout body it has a long slender one;
and instead of short, thick tentacles, like the
petals of a dahlia, it has a bunch of almost thread-like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
arms, which really rather remind one of
little white snakes. And when they are spread
these long arms are hardly ever still, but are
always waving about in the water.</p>

</div>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>When the snake-locked anemone closes up,
however, you would never know it for the same
creature, for it not only draws its long tentacles
back into its body and tucks them away out
of sight, but contracts the body itself until it is
almost flat. Unless you looked very carefully
at the rock to which it was clinging you would
never notice it at all.</p>

<p>This anemone is not a very common one, and
is chiefly found on the rocky coasts of Devonshire
and Cornwall. In colour it is almost white.</p>

MADREPORES, CORALS, AND
SPONGES</h2>
</div>

<h3>PLATE XLIII<br />

MADREPORES (1)</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">IN some ways these curious creatures are very
much like sea anemones, and if you were to
find one with its tentacles spread you would be
almost sure to think that it was a small anemone.
But if you touched it you would find that you
had made a mistake, for instead of closing itself
up into an almost shapeless lump of jelly, as
the anemones do, it would just draw back its
tentacles, and leave a kind of flinty skeleton
still standing up. For madrepores are really
much more like the wonderful little creatures
which make coral. They suck lime, in some
strange manner which nobody quite understands,
out of the sea-water, and build it up round and
underneath their own bodies. And if you startle
them in any way they draw themselves down
inside this shelly covering, and disappear from
sight altogether; so that all that you can see
is a number of thin plates standing upright on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
their edges, and looking rather like the lower
surface of a mushroom turned into stone.</p>

<p>Madrepores feed on very tiny animals, such as
the fry of small fishes, and the zoeas of shrimps
and prawns. And they catch their victims by
means of a number of fleshy tentacles, which are
very much like those of the sea anemones, except
that they always have little round knobs at the
tips. These tentacles are set with numbers of
tiny cells containing slender poisoned darts,
just as those of the anemones are.</p>

<p>If you want to find madrepores, you must look
for them among the rocks near the water&#8217;s edge
when the tide is at its lowest. But they are not
very common, and on many parts of the coast
they are never found at all.</p>


<h3>PLATE XLIII<br />

THE SEA FINGER (2)</h3>

<p>If you walk along the shore as the tide goes
out, you may often find a soft, pink, fleshy object
which has been thrown up by the waves. And
if you search among the pools at low-water,
you are nearly sure to see other soft, pink, fleshy
objects just like it growing upon their rocky sides,
or upon the stones and shells which lie at the
bottom. They are often known as &#8220;dead men&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
fingers,&#8221; or &#8220;dead men&#8217;s toes.&#8221; But as those
are not very nice names, we will call these objects
&#8220;sea fingers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now if you pick up one of these sea fingers
and look at it carefully, you will see that its
surface is pierced all over with numbers of tiny
holes. And if you take a good strong magnifying-glass,
and look at one of the holes through that,
you will see that it is shaped like a little flower
with eight petals, or a star with eight rays.</p>

<p>The fact is that the sea finger is the home
of a most curious animal; or perhaps one should
rather say that it is the home of hundreds of most
curious animals. Indeed, it is not at all easy
to know which is the right way to describe it.
For if you were to take a living sea finger, and
to put it into a vessel of clear sea-water, you
would very soon notice that a little tiny star-shaped
animal had poked itself out of each little
star-shaped hole. There would be hundreds of
these little animals&mdash;or &#8220;polyps,&#8221; as they are
called&mdash;altogether. But yet they would only have
one body between them, for they are joined
together in such a wonderful way that the food
which is caught and eaten by one polyp nourishes
all the others as well as itself!</p>

<h3>PLATE XLIV<br />

THE TUFT CORAL (1)</h3>

<p>Nearly all the coral-building animals are found
in the tropical seas, for they can only live in water
which is quite warm all the year round. But
there are just a very few which are sometimes
found off our own shores, and one of these is
the Tuft Coral. It looks rather like a tree which
has just been &#8220;pollarded&#8221; by having all the small
branches taken away and all the big ones cut
quite short; and sometimes it weighs as much
as six or even seven pounds.</p>

<p>People sometimes say that the curious substance
which we call &#8220;coral&#8221; is made by &#8220;coral
insects.&#8221; But the little animals which make it
are not related in any way to the true insects.
They are really tiny polyps, very much like those
of the sea finger; and they suck up lime out of
the water, and build it up underneath and round
their own bodies, just as the madrepores do.</p>

<p>If you were to place one of these tuft corals
in a vessel of clear sea-water, and to watch it carefully,
you would soon see the little polyps poking
themselves out, and spreading their tiny fleshy
feelers, or &#8220;tentacles.&#8221; The coral which they
make is pearly white in colour, with just a faint
tinge of rosy red, and the polyps themselves are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
partly white, and partly fawn, and partly chestnut
brown.</p>

<p>One does not often find a tuft coral, however,
for the polyps like to live in rather deep water.
But when there is a very high spring-tide, as
there generally is about the end of March and
the end of September, the waves retreat afterwards
a good deal farther than usual. And then,
if you go right down to the water&#8217;s edge, you
may perhaps find a tuft coral fastened to the
rocks.</p>


<h3>PLATE XLIV<br />

THE BREAD-CRUMB SPONGE (2)</h3>

<p>I dare say that you will be rather surprised
to hear that nearly three hundred different kinds
of sponges have been found in the British seas.
You will not be able to find very many of these,
however, for they nearly all live in deep water,
and have to be scooped up by means of the
dredge. But the Bread-crumb Sponge is easily
found, for it lives in shallow water, and you
are nearly sure to find it if you look for it in
the rock-pools.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="chapter">
<p class="ph1"><a id="plate44"><span class="smcap">Plate XLIV</span></a></p>

3. THE GRANTIA SPONGE.<span class="gap">4. FORAMINIFERA.</span></p>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>But I hardly think that anybody, on seeing
it for the first time, would take it to be a sponge
at all. For it is not in the least like a bath
sponge. It is just a kind of fleshy crust, sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
greenish in colour and sometimes yellow,
which grows round the stems of sea-weed, or
covers the surfaces of rocks and stones. And
the odd thing about it is that when it clings to
sea-weeds its surface is quite smooth, with a
number of large holes in it, but that when it
grows on rocks it is covered all over with little
projections which look just like the craters of
volcanoes.</p>

<p>It is rather difficult to describe the animal
which lives in the sponge, for it really consists
of a large number of tiny animals all joined
together in one common mass, very much like
the polyps of the sea finger. But they are so
very small that unless you examine them by
means of a good strong microscope they only
look like a mass of brownish jelly.</p>

<p>These little creatures obtain their food in a
very curious way. If you look at the surface
of the sponge through a magnifying-glass, you
will see that it is pierced by a great many very
tiny holes as well as by a number of bigger
ones. Now water is always passing in through
the small holes and out again through the big
ones; and as it does so the little creatures
manage to suck out all the tiny atoms of animal
and vegetable matter which were floating about
in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span></p>


<h3>PLATE XLIV<br />

THE GRANTIA SPONGE (3)</h3>

<p>This is quite a small sponge, which you may
often find by hunting about in the rock-pools
just above low-water mark. Sometimes it clings
to sea-weeds, and sometimes it hangs down from
the surfaces of the rocks; and when you find
one you are almost sure to find several others
close by.</p>

<p>In appearance, they are rather like little flat
white bags, or purses; and when they reach
their full size they are generally about an inch
long and an inch and a half wide.</p>


<h3>PLATE XLIV<br />

FORAMINIFERA (4)</h3>

<p>&#8220;Foraminifera!&#8221; That is rather a long name;
isn&#8217;t it? But if we cut it in two, and strike out
one of the letters, we shall see what it means.
<i>Foramin-(i)-fera</i>. Now the first part of the name
is a Latin word which means &#8220;a hole,&#8221; and the
last part is another Latin word which signifies
&#8220;bearers.&#8221; So &#8220;foraminifera&#8221; means &#8220;hole-bearers,&#8221;

very tiny creatures which live in the sea because
they inhabit shells, which are pierced all over
by numbers and numbers of still tinier holes.</p>

<p>These foraminifera are so very small that
numbers of them can live in a single drop of
water! Yet, strange to say, all the chalk in the
world is made of their shells! For in days of
old&mdash;thousands and thousands of years ago&mdash;they
were found in the sea in millions of millions
of millions. And as they died their empty shells
sank down to the bottom of the sea in such
enormous numbers that at last they formed a
layer hundreds of feet thick. Then suddenly
one day there came a great earthquake, and a
great deal of this vast layer of shells was forced
up above the surface in the form of what we
now call chalk. So that &#8220;the chalk cliffs of old
England&#8221; are really made of nothing but shells,
so very small indeed that you cannot see them
without the help of a very strong microscope!</p>

<p>There are a great many different kinds of
foraminifera. But if you look at them through
a good microscope you will always see that
their shells are pierced by the tiny holes from
which they take their name.</p>

SEA-WEEDS</h2>

<h3>PLATE XLV<br />

THE BLADDER-WRACK (1)</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;DARE say that you would like to know something
about the sea-weeds which you may find
on the shore; so I am now going to describe
some of those which you are almost certain to
meet with.</p>

<p>First of all, then, and commonest of all, there
is the bladder-wrack. Wherever there are rocks
on which it can grow you will always see it in
great masses. And after every storm enormous
quantities of it are torn off and flung upon the
beach. Then the farmers send down their carts
to carry it away. For after it has been piled up
in heaps for some time, so as to allow it partly
to decay, it makes a most useful manure; and
the farmers are only too glad to be able to spread
it over their fields.</p>

<p>This plant is called the &#8220;bladder-wrack&#8221; because
of the odd little oval bladders filled with
air which are found in the leaves, and which
explode with a slight report if you tread upon
them or squeeze them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span></p>


<h3>PLATE XLV<br />

THE OAR WEED (2)</h3>

<p>This is a very fine sea-weed indeed, for it often
grows to a height of ten or eleven feet. But
you are not likely to see it growing, for it lives
in rather deep water, where it is always covered
even at the lowest tides. It is often flung up
by the waves, however, and you must many times
have noticed its long, thick stem and flat plate-like
leaves lying upon the shore as the tide was
going down.</p>

<p>The stem of the oar weed is often used for
making the handles of knives. When it is quite
fresh, it is so soft that the &#8220;tang&#8221; of a knife-blade&mdash;the
part, that is, which is fastened into the
handle&mdash;can be forced into it quite easily. But
if it is put aside for a few months to dry it
becomes as hard and solid as horn, and holds
the blade so firmly that it is almost impossible
to pull it out again.</p>

<p>If you look at the &#8220;roots&#8221; of the oar weed
you will see that they are not like those of plants
which grow in the ground, but are really very
strong suckers. For sea-weeds do not send their
roots down into the rock, as land plants do into
the ground, but merely cling to the surface.
That is why they are so easily torn up by the
waves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span></p>


<h3>PLATE XLVI<br />

CORALLINE (1)</h3>

<p>For a great many years naturalists could not
make up their minds whether this very pretty
sea-weed was really a sea-weed or not. For it
possesses the curious power of sucking out lime
from the sea-water and building it up round
itself, just as the polyps of the madrepores and
the corals do: so that when it dies and decays
it leaves a kind of chalky skeleton behind it. For
this reason it was often supposed to be really a
kind of coral. We know now, however, that it
is a plant. For if it is placed in acid, which
dissolves away this &#8220;skeleton,&#8221; we find that a true
vegetable framework is left behind it.</p>

<p>While it is alive the coralline is of a deep purple
colour. It is quite a small plant, growing only
to a height of four or five inches, and you may
find it in quantities on the rocks near low-water
mark.</p>


<h3>PLATE XLVI<br />

DULSE (2)</h3>

<p>This weed is also known as the Dillisk, or
Dillosk. I dare say that you have often seen
it, for it is quite common on nearly all the rocky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
parts of our coasts, sometimes growing on the
rocks themselves, and sometimes on the larger
sea-weeds. In colour, it is a deep, dark red, and
if you look down upon it on a bright sunny day,
as it grows in a pool of clear sea-water, you
may see all kinds of lovely rainbow tints playing
over its leaves. The leaves or &#8220;fronds&#8221; as they
are more properly called, are about two inches
long and a quarter of an inch wide.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p>The dulse is one of the sea-weeds which are
used for food. On many parts of the coast of
Ireland it is very largely eaten, both boiled and
raw, and some people are so fond of it that they
have it for breakfast every day.</p>


<h3>PLATE XLVII<br />

THE GREEN LAVER (1)</h3>

<p>Another name for this plant is the Sea Lettuce;
and certainly, with its broad, bright green,
crinkled leaves, it does look rather like a cabbage
lettuce. It is a very useful plant to keep in a
salt-water aquarium, for its leaves give off little
bubbles of oxygen gas, which help to keep the
water pure and fit for fishes and other creatures
to live in. If you look at it on a bright sunny
day you will often find that the leaves are covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
all over with these tiny bubbles, which look just
like little drops of quicksilver.</p>

<p>The green laver is found in abundance on
most of our rocky coasts, and is often boiled
down into a kind of jelly and used as food.</p>


<h3>PLATE XLVII<br />

THE PURPLE LAVER (2)</h3>

<p>This plant is very much like the green laver,
except that it is purple in colour instead of
green. It is often boiled down into jelly and
used as food, more especially in Ireland, where
it is generally known as &#8220;sloke,&#8221; and is cooked
and brought to table in a silver saucepan.</p>


<h3>PLATE XLVIII<br />

CARRAGEEN MOSS (1)</h3>

<p>I do not know why this plant should be called
a moss, for it is not in the least like the true
mosses, as you can easily see by looking at the
illustration. It is very common indeed, growing
both in the pools among the rocks and also in
deep water. But it is not a very easy plant to
describe, for it varies very much in colour, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
sometimes green, and sometimes yellow, and
sometimes purple. Like the dulse, it is often
used for food, being boiled down into a kind
of jelly, and then either eaten by itself, or
mixed with tea or coffee. It makes very good
size, too, and is used a good deal in the manufacture
of calico. Farmers use it, too, for fattening
calves, and also for mixing with the potatoes
or meal with which the pigs are fed. So that
altogether it is a very useful sea-weed indeed.</p>

<h3>PLATE XLVIII<br />

THE SEA GRASS (2)</h3>

<p>This is a very pretty sea-weed, which you may
often find growing in great quantities in the
pools which are left among the rocks as the
tide goes down. When its long, narrow fronds
are waving to and fro in the water it really
looks most lovely, and you can almost fancy
that you are gazing down into fairyland. And
as the shrimps and prawns and little fishes dart
in and out among its bright green leaves, one
might almost imagine them to be the fairies!</p>

<p>The fronds of this pretty sea-weed vary a good
deal in width, for sometimes they are like strips
of narrow ribbon, and sometimes they are scarcely
broader than hairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span></p>


<h3>PLATE XLVIII<br />

THE GRASS WRACK (3)</h3>

<p>In one way this is the most curious of all the
plants which you may find on the shore. For
it is not really a sea-weed at all, but is a flowering
plant which somehow or other has taken to
living at the bottom of the sea. You may often
find it in the deeper pools just above low-water
mark; and you can tell it at once by its very
long, very narrow, bright green leaves. These
leaves are often three or four feet in length,
while they are only about three-eighths of an
inch wide; so that really they do look very much
like blades of grass.</p>

<p>The grass wrack is not one of the true grasses,
however, for it has real flowers, which grow in
a kind of sheath formed by one of the shorter
leaves. And its stem creeps along under the
muddy sand, and throws up leaves at intervals,
very much like that of the common bracken.
On many parts of the coast it grows in the
greatest abundance. There are large fields of
it, so to speak, below low-water mark, which
afford refuge for all kinds of small sea-creatures.
Indeed, if you want to catch these animals for
yourself, the very best way to do it is to wait
until the tide is quite low, and then to wade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
into the water and fish about in the masses of
grass wrack with a small net.</p>

</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>Great quantities of the long, narrow leaves
of this plant are often flung up on the shore;
and when they have been thoroughly dried they
are often used for packing glass or china, instead
of hay or straw.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
